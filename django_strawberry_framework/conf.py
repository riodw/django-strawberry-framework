"""Package settings, read from the host project's ``DJANGO_STRAWBERRY_FRAMEWORK`` dict.

User-provided settings live in a top-level Django settings dict named
``DJANGO_STRAWBERRY_FRAMEWORK``.  Access them via the module-level
``settings`` instance::

    from django_strawberry_framework.conf import settings
    settings.SOME_KEY

Missing keys raise ``AttributeError``.  Whenever Django's
``setting_changed`` signal fires (for example, in tests using
``pytest-django``'s ``settings`` fixture), the singleton ``settings``
instance is mutated in place - the module global is *not* rebound - so
references bound via ``from .conf import settings`` see the change
immediately.

Defensive ``None`` stance (package-wide). Two top-level
consumer-input seams coerce ``None`` (and the missing-key case) to an
empty mapping rather than raising: ``DJANGO_STRAWBERRY_FRAMEWORK =
None`` (this module, treated as "no settings configured") and
``Meta.optimizer_hints = None`` in ``types/base.py`` (treated as "no
hints configured"). Both behave identically to omitting the value
entirely. Tightening the ``None`` cases to raise is tracked as
future-slice work; until then the empty-mapping coercion is the
documented contract for ``None``. *Other* invalid shapes are no longer
defensively coerced here: a non-mapping ``DJANGO_STRAWBERRY_FRAMEWORK``
value raises ``ConfigurationError`` through
``_normalize_user_settings`` before attribute lookup, rather than the
old ``or {}`` collapse that silently absorbed every falsy value.
Reflective shape reads off Strawberry / graphql-core / Django
descriptors (``getattr(obj, name, None) or {}`` and friends in the
optimizer subpackage) are a *separate* case - there the upstream
contract genuinely allows the attribute to be absent or ``None`` on
legitimate shapes, and coercion is unconditionally correct. Do not
unify the two.
