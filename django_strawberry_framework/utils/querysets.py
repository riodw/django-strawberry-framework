"""Query-source + ``DjangoType.get_queryset`` visibility contract, single-sited.

The neutral query-source mechanics every resolver surface shares: coerce a
``Manager`` to a ``QuerySet`` exactly once, decide whether a value is a
queryset, run the ``DjangoType.get_queryset`` visibility hook through the sync
or async path, and combine those into the list-field consumer-resolver shape.
Extracted here (the 0.0.9 DRY pass, ``docs/feedback.md`` Major 1) so list
fields, connection fields, the optimizer middleware, the Relay node defaults,
and the filter related-visibility derive all reach ONE implementation of the
contract -- ``get_queryset`` is the visibility hook, and a visibility-hook
mistake is a data-leak bug, so the routing must not be re-decided per surface.

Caller-specific tails stay with their caller: the connection field keeps its
GraphQL non-queryset error (it calls ``normalize_query_source`` then guards),
the Relay node defaults keep their id filter, the optimizer keeps plan
building, and the filter related derive keeps its per-branch recursion. This
module owns only the source normalization + the colored visibility calls.

Cycle-safe by construction: it depends on nothing but ``django`` and
``..exceptions``, so ``types/relay.py`` (imported at module top by
``types/base.py``) can import from here without closing a load cycle, and it
never imports back into the package.
