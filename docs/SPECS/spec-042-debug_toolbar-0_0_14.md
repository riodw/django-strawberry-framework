# Spec: Debug-toolbar middleware — `DebugToolbarMiddleware` in a soft-`django-debug-toolbar` `middleware/debug_toolbar.py`, the SQL-panel window into `/graphql/` requests

Built for `0.0.14` (card [`DONE-042-0.0.14`][kanban]); the `0.0.14` version
release rides the joint cut with 043 / 044 (see `Status:` below). This card adds the
package's **`django-debug-toolbar` integration**: a new
`django_strawberry_framework/middleware/debug_toolbar.py` module exposing
`DebugToolbarMiddleware` — a subclass of `debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware`
that overrides `process_view` (to tag Strawberry-Django-view requests) and `_postprocess` (to
inject the toolbar payload into the two GraphQL response shapes) — plus its
template asset at
`django_strawberry_framework/templates/django_strawberry_framework/debug_toolbar.html`.
It is a Required 🍓 `strawberry-graphql-django` parity item (the card's own tag):
[`strawberry_django/middlewares/debug_toolbar.py`][upstream-middleware] ships a
`DebugToolbarMiddleware` of the same shape, and without an equivalent,
`django-debug-toolbar`'s SQL panel never captures the queries a `/graphql/`
request triggers — developers cannot see the SQL their GraphQL selections
actually hit, which for a package whose headline is a cooperative N+1 optimizer
([`DjangoOptimizerExtension`][glossary-djangooptimizerextension]) is the single
most useful dev-time window into whether the plan did what the consumer expects.
`graphene-django` ships **no** equivalent (the card's own "Why it matters"), so
this is honest [single-upstream parity][glossary-single-upstream-parity] — the
same posture [`spec-041`][spec-041] took for the Channels router and
[`spec-040`][spec-040] took for the [auth module][glossary-auth-mutations].

The middleware is deliberately **thin and upstream-riding**: `django-debug-toolbar`
owns the panels, the request tracking, the handle rendering, and the stock
middleware lifecycle; the package contributes exactly the two overrides upstream
contributes — Strawberry-view tagging and payload injection — plus the ~45-line
template that teaches the toolbar's frontend to consume the injected payload.
`django-debug-toolbar` is a **[soft dependency][glossary-soft-dependency]**
([Decision 5](#decision-5--soft-django-debug-toolbar-dependency-an-import-time-require_debug_toolbar-guard-the-rest_framework-shape)) —
the package's third, after `djangorestframework` ([`spec-039`][spec-039]) and
`channels` ([`spec-041`][spec-041]): `import django_strawberry_framework` and
`import django_strawberry_framework.middleware` both succeed without it, and the
install-hint `ImportError` fires when the consumer actually imports the
middleware module — which for a Django middleware is exactly the `MIDDLEWARE`
dotted-path import at server startup, the earliest moment the integration is
reached for.

**Version boundary** (see
[Decision 10](#decision-10--version-bumps-are-owned-by-the-joint-0014-cut)): this
card **shares the `0.0.14` patch line** with two open siblings —
[`TODO-ALPHA-043-0.0.14`][kanban] ([`TestClient`][glossary-testclient] /
[`GraphQLTestCase`][glossary-graphqltestcase]) and
[`TODO-ALPHA-044-0.0.14`][kanban] ([Response-extensions debug
middleware][glossary-response-extensions-debug-middleware]) — and follows
[`DONE-041-0.0.14`][kanban] ([`DjangoGraphQLProtocolRouter`][glossary-djangographqlprotocolrouter]),
which already deferred its own cut to the same [joint `0.0.14`
cut][glossary-joint-version-cut]. So the `pyproject.toml` / `__version__` /
[`tests/base/test_init.py::test_version`][test-base-init] bump from `0.0.13` to
`0.0.14` is owned by the **joint cut** (the last `0.0.14` card to land), not by
this card — the same shared-cut posture [`spec-041`][spec-041] Decision 10 and
[`spec-039`][spec-039] Decision 14 took. No slice below bumps the version.

Status: **COMPLETE (card `DONE-042-0.0.14`) — both slices built and the card-wrap landed; the `0.0.14` version release rides the joint cut (043 / 044 pending).**
Two slices (the card is an M with one module, one template, and one test file):
Slice 1 (**the dependency gate + `middleware/debug_toolbar.py` + the template +
`tests/middleware/test_debug_toolbar.py`** — the `django-debug-toolbar` dev-group
add with the lockfile regenerated, the soft-dependency guard, the middleware
subclass, the template asset, and both the toolbar-present and toolbar-absent
test paths land in one commit), and Slice 2 (**docs + card wrap** — the
implemented-contract doc updates, the regenerated [`docs/TREE.md`][tree], and the
kanban card flip; the release-status wording and the version bump stay deferred
to the joint cut).

Owner: package maintainer.

Predecessors: [`spec-041-channels_router-0_0_14.md`][spec-041] (the
most-recently-shipped spec and the canonical voice / depth / section-layout
reference; also the card that landed
[`require_optional_module`][glossary-require-optional-module] in
[`utils/imports.py`][utils-imports] — the raising optional-import primitive this
card's guard rides — and generalized the [soft-dependency][glossary-soft-dependency]
architecture to a second integration; `django-debug-toolbar` becomes the third);
[`spec-039-serializer_mutations-0_0_13.md`][spec-039] (the original
soft-dependency card — the single `require_*()` guard with one install-hint
string, the dev-group + lockfile dependency gate, and the
[eviction-simulated absence][glossary-eviction-simulated-absence] test
discipline); [`spec-040-auth_mutations-0_0_13.md`][spec-040] (the
single-upstream-parity posture precedent). [`docs/GLOSSARY.md`][glossary] carries
[Debug-toolbar middleware][glossary-debug-toolbar-middleware] as `planned for
0.0.14`; Slice 2 updates the entry body to the implemented contract while the
`shipped (0.0.14)` status flip rides the joint cut.

Revision history (kept inline so the spec is self-contained):

- **Revision 1** — initial draft authored from the [`DONE-042-0.0.14`][kanban]
  card body via the [`docs/SPECS/NEXT.md`][next] flow (2026-07-06). Pinned: the
  canonical structured filename
  ([Decision 1](#decision-1--spec-filename-and-canonical-naming)); the card-scope
  boundary — the server-side toolbar integration ships, the in-response
  `extensions` surface stays with the sibling card, fakeshop's shipped settings
  stay toolbar-free, no new `Meta` / settings key
  ([Decision 2](#decision-2--card-scope-boundary-the-server-side-toolbar-integration-ships-the-in-response-surface-fakeshop-settings-opt-in-and-async-verification-stay-out));
  the `DebugToolbarMiddleware` symbol name — deliberately the **same** class
  name as both upstream and stock `django-debug-toolbar`, distinguished by the
  module path, because a Django middleware's public identity IS its dotted
  settings string
  ([Decision 3](#decision-3--the-symbol-is-debugtoolbarmiddleware--same-class-name-distinctly-ours-dotted-path));
  the `middleware/` subpackage + template-asset + `tests/middleware/` locations
  ([Decision 4](#decision-4--module-template-and-test-locations-a-middleware-subpackage-an-in-package-template-asset-testsmiddleware));
  the soft-`django-debug-toolbar` guard as an **import-time**
  `require_debug_toolbar()` at module top (the `rest_framework/__init__.py`
  shape, NOT the `routers.py` PEP 562 lazy-symbol shape — the module import is
  itself the opt-in, per the card's own DoD wording), with the
  `django-debug-toolbar>=7.0.0` dev-group add + lockfile regeneration as the
  Slice-1 dependency gate — the floor deliberately **above** upstream's
  `>=6.0.0` because `7.0.0` is the first release with the Django 6.0 classifier
  the package advertises (PyPI metadata: `6.0.0` classifies 4.2–5.2 only)
  ([Decision 5](#decision-5--soft-django-debug-toolbar-dependency-an-import-time-require_debug_toolbar-guard-the-rest_framework-shape));
  the subclass-and-override shape borrowed as-is — `process_view` +
  `_postprocess`, the module-level `_get_payload` helper, the `_HTML_TYPES`
  constant, the `TemplatesPanel` skip, and the `DjangoJSONEncoder` re-encode
  ([Decision 6](#decision-6--subclass-and-override-borrowed-as-is-process_view--_postprocess-_get_payload-_html_types));
  the Strawberry-view detection pinned against engine-owned
  `strawberry.django.views.BaseView`, resolving the card's `DjangoGraphQLView`
  working-name hedge — the package ships no view class of its own; fakeshop and
  every documented consumer path wire Strawberry's Django views directly
  ([Decision 7](#decision-7--strawberry-view-detection-issubclass-against-strawberrydjangoviewsbaseview-engine-owned--resolving-the-cards-djangographqlview-hedge));
  the introspection-query skip preserved verbatim
  ([Decision 8](#decision-8--the-introspection-query-skip-is-preserved-verbatim));
  the package-tests placement with real in-process fakeshop `/graphql/`
  requests under per-test settings overrides, justified against the
  [live-first mandate][glossary-live-first-coverage-mandate] — fakeshop's
  shipped configuration deliberately carries no soft-dependency middleware, so
  no live request through the example's own settings can reach these lines
  ([Decision 9](#decision-9--test-strategy-package-tests-driving-real-in-process-fakeshop-requests-under-settings-overrides-eviction-simulated-absence));
  and the joint-cut version deferral
  ([Decision 10](#decision-10--version-bumps-are-owned-by-the-joint-0014-cut)).
  One coupling tension is carried into [Risks](#risks-and-open-questions) rather
  than silently reconciled: `_postprocess` is a private-underscore method of
  `django-debug-toolbar` — upstream subclasses it anyway (with `@override`), and
  this card borrows that coupling knowingly, with the floor gate and the
  behavior-level tests as the containment.
- **Revision 2** — maintainer-review absorption (2026-07-06/07, two review
  rounds). First round: the injection contract restated honestly as
  view-scoped rather than IDE-scoped; `debug_toolbar_urls()` added as the
  third required setup piece (public docs, fixture, panel-fetch test); the
  fixture corrected to re-enable `DEBUG=True` (pytest-django's
  `django_debug_mode` default forces the suite to `DEBUG=False`) with an
  always-true `SHOW_TOOLBAR_CALLBACK` and debug-toolbar cache hygiene; the
  no-toolbar baseline moved off byte-equality; pytest restraint recorded.
  Second round: the test-URLconf import-ordering contract (named module
  `tests/middleware/debug_toolbar_urls.py`, dotted-path-only reference,
  `sys.modules` eviction on setup/teardown so `urlpatterns` compute under
  `DEBUG=True`); Test 3 changed to a **named** operation (a non-null
  `operationName` requires one); the order-dependent "module not imported"
  baseline assertion removed in favor of the absence tests; `django_db`
  marking pinned for the toolbar-present group; the coverage claims mapped
  branch-by-branch with new targeted units for the branches
  real requests cannot reach; the fixture's `MIDDLEWARE` built from the real
  stack and the `DebugToolbar` class caches handled save/clear/restore;
  `render_panel`'s JSON `content`/`scripts` response shape pinned; remaining
  "GraphiQL-tagged/-view" phrasing renamed to Strawberry-view terms (Decision
  7's heading and anchors updated); the ASGI boundary restated as three
  precise claims; and the debug-toolbar 7.0.0 source files added to the
  external link block.
- **Revision 3** — third-review absorption (2026-07-07). The JSON leak guard
  gained its own real-request negative (Test 8: a test-only JSON probe view in
  the test URLconf must come back with an unmodified body and no `debugToolbar`
  key — the HTML negatives alone could not catch an inject-into-every-JSON
  implementation); the HTML negative (Test 7) made explicitly package-scoped
  (the stock toolbar handle may legitimately appear under the fixture's
  always-true callback); the targeted `_postprocess` units reworded around
  `super()._postprocess(...)` running first (protocol-complete fake toolbar;
  "no package-specific mutation", not "no touch"); the absence import blocker
  pinned to absolute top-level `debug_toolbar` names only (the
  `tests/test_routers.py` scoping), so the leaf always reaches
  `require_debug_toolbar()` (**this last point superseded by Revision 5** — the
  `importlib`-based guard needs a `sys.modules` sentinel, not a `__import__`
  block); and the template-port checklist gained a mechanical guard (Test 16)
  asserting the five copied-asset invariants as substring checks.
- **Revision 4** — fourth-review absorption (2026-07-07, source-verified
  against the debug-toolbar 7.0.0 tag). Two factual corrections: the
  missing-URLconf failure mode rewritten everywhere it appears (User-facing
  API, Decision 9's fixture bullet, Test 6, both GLOSSARY checklist items) —
  the stock postprocess renders the toolbar unconditionally for every
  processed response and the render reverses `djdt:` routes, so omitting
  `debug_toolbar_urls()` is a hard `NoReverseMatch` on the first
  toolbar-processed request, not a quiet panel-click 404; and Test 6's
  assertion strengthened past the shape check — `render_panel` returns 200
  JSON with non-empty `content` even when the id resolves to nothing (the
  "isn't available anymore" fallback), so the test now asserts the fallback
  absent and a seeded-operation SQL marker present. Precision edits: Decision
  6 states what `super()._postprocess(...)` actually does in order (per-panel
  stats/timing, unconditional render/store — the mechanism Test 6 rides and
  the dev-cost of tagged JSON operations — headers, then conditional HTML
  handle); a staticfiles + `STATIC_URL` edge-case bullet (the toolbar's own
  prerequisite, surfacing on `/graphql/` under this middleware); and the
  template-port paragraph corrected to a byte-identical copy claim (the
  upstream asset contains no Django template tags to adapt).
- **Revision 5** — fifth-review absorption (2026-07-08), verified empirically
  before absorbing. **P1 — the absence-test mechanism.** The toolbar-absent
  fixture no longer copies the router/DRF `builtins.__import__` block:
  `require_debug_toolbar()` is a thin
  [`require_optional_module`][glossary-require-optional-module] wrapper, i.e. an
  `importlib.import_module("debug_toolbar")` call, and `importlib` routes
  through `importlib._bootstrap._gcd_import` — it does **not** consult
  `builtins.__import__`. So the block is a no-op for the guard: it re-imports
  the still-installed toolbar, and the raise (if any) comes from a later
  hintless statement-import, not the wrapped guard — Tests 10/12 would have
  failed for the wrong reason. Corrected to an importlib-compatible
  `sys.modules["debug_toolbar"] = None` sentinel everywhere the mechanism is
  prescribed (this glossary bullet, Decision 9, D3, the Slice checklist, the
  Test-plan header, Tests 10/12); the eviction + **two-sided restore**
  discipline is unchanged. This supersedes Revision 3's "the leaf always reaches
  `require_debug_toolbar()` under the block" reasoning. **P1 — the degraded
  path.** A present-but-broken-install test (Test 11a) was added so the numbered
  plan actually pins what the [Error shapes](#error-shapes) prose already
  claimed it pinned. **P2 — two narrow, documented robustness divergences** from
  the verbatim upstream borrow, each pinned by a targeted unit: `process_view`
  guards `issubclass` with `isinstance(view, type)` so a non-class `view_class`
  on unrelated global traffic cannot `TypeError`/500 (a `TypeError` was
  reproduced); `_get_payload` bails to `None` on a non-object JSON body.
  **Documentation:** `application/graphql-response+json` stated explicitly out
  of scope (a follow-up compatibility item); a strict-CSP caveat added for the
  inline GraphiQL bridge script; the dependency-floor prose reworded off
  "current release" to a verified-floor claim (`7.0.0` confirmed on PyPI as the
  first release carrying the `Framework :: Django :: 6.0` classifier). No change
  to the template-port guard (already substring-based, not a golden file) or the
  fixture-locality question (already file-local; inner-helper names now named).
- **Revision 6** — sixth-review absorption (2026-07-08), verified against the
  debug-toolbar 7.0.0 import chain. **P2 — the missing-`INSTALLED_APPS` gap.**
  The Error-shapes analysis covered a missing package and a broken install but
  not the case of a package that is installed while `"debug_toolbar"` is absent
  from `INSTALLED_APPS` — a common misconfiguration whose failure (traced
  through `debug_toolbar.middleware`, `debug_toolbar.toolbar`,
  `debug_toolbar.store`, then `from debug_toolbar.models import HistoryEntry`) is
  Django's cryptic `HistoryEntry` app-label `RuntimeError`, which never names the
  missing app and so is not self-actionable. Added a **second wiring gate** in
  the leaf (`apps.is_installed("debug_toolbar")` immediately after
  `require_debug_toolbar()`, raising `ImproperlyConfigured` from
  `_DEBUG_TOOLBAR_APP_HINT`), a new [Error shapes](#error-shapes) bullet, and
  Test 11b (toolbar importable, app omitted, `ImproperlyConfigured` asserted).
  This is the card's one deliberate step outside the pure-`ImportError` error
  model — an `INSTALLED_APPS` omission is a settings error and
  `ImproperlyConfigured` is Django's idiom for it; the "top-level package only"
  scope still governs `require_debug_toolbar()`'s import guard, a separate
  concern from this wiring gate.
- **Revision 7** — seventh-review absorption (2026-07-08). **P2 — the ported
  GraphiQL bridge template broke global `JSON.parse` semantics.** As a verbatim
  borrow the asset inherited two upstream bugs that are unsafe once the hook is a
  *global* patch: `JSON.parse = function (text)` dropped the standard `reviver`
  argument (every page-wide `JSON.parse(text, reviver)` lost its reviver while
  GraphiQL was open), and `update`'s `data.hasOwnProperty(...)` guard threw for
  null-prototype / `hasOwnProperty`-shadowing objects. Hardened to
  `origParse.apply(this, arguments)` (reviver preserved),
  `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(...)` behind a `typeof data !== "object"`
  bail, and an `if (djDebug === null)` guard before DOM mutation — the card's
  **third** documented robustness divergence from the verbatim borrow
  (template-side; the middleware carries the other two), recorded in the
  [Template-port checklist](#from-strawberry-graphql-django--borrow-the-mechanism-verbatim)
  and re-pinned by Test 16 (renamed to
  `test_template_port_invariants_and_robustness_divergence`). **P3 — the shared
  soft-dependency test helper.** `tests/_soft_dependency.py::evicted_modules`
  tracked parent-attr presence with a `None` check whose teardown `hasattr` probe
  could fire a package `__getattr__` (the exact footgun the helper's docstring
  claims to avoid); it now uses a `missing` sentinel with `vars(parent).pop` (no
  `hasattr`/`delattr`), and its docstring no longer claims `require_drf` uses a
  statement `import` (it delegates to `require_optional_module` like the other two
  guards). The tracked `examples/fakeshop/db.sqlite3` diff was reviewed and
  **kept by maintainer decision** (not feature residue to revert). **Slice 2 (the
  docs card-wrap) was finished this pass** on top of a concurrent kanban
  card-wrap that had already flipped the card to `DONE-042-0.0.14`: this pass
  ticked the shipped definition-of-done items, ran `import_spec_terms` (which
  reconciles every done card, so the `db.sqlite3` diff legitimately spans card
  040's post-archive `docs/SPECS/` path), regenerated the DB-backed `KANBAN` /
  `GLOSSARY` and script-rendered `TREE` docs, and flipped this status line + the
  `README` off their planned wording. The `Debug-toolbar middleware` glossary
  body now carries the implemented contract (its status stays `planned for
  0.0.14` until the joint cut). The kanban tables stay owned by the concurrent
  writer; the mixed DB + generated-doc diff is handed to the maintainer to
  reconcile at commit.
- **Revision 8** — eighth-review absorption (2026-07-08, `docs/feedback.md`).
  **P2 — the GraphiQL bridge could still leak the server-only `debugToolbar` key
  and could throw inside the global `JSON.parse` patch.** Revision 7's
  `if (djDebug === null) return data;` guard returned *before*
  `delete data.debugToolbar`, so a page whose toolbar DOM did not render returned
  the debug payload back to GraphiQL unscrubbed; and the per-panel DOM writes
  assumed every panel in the payload had a matching content/nav node, so a
  panel/DOM mismatch threw inside the patched `JSON.parse` /
  `Response.prototype.json` and broke the IDE response path rather than skipping
  one panel. Both are the same class the Revision-7 divergences already address.
  Hardened so **payload scrubbing is mandatory and DOM updates are best-effort**:
  the `debugToolbar` key is captured and deleted *before* the null-handle bail,
  the panel loop is a side-effect-only `forEach` that skips an absent content
  node and writes the nav subtitle only when the nav item exists. This grows the
  card's third (template-side) divergence from two spots to a four-guard family
  unified by that rule (see the [Template-port checklist](#from-strawberry-graphql-django--borrow-the-mechanism-verbatim));
  the DOM-update body is otherwise still upstream's. Test 16 gains an ordering
  assertion pinning the scrub before the null-handle bail. **P3 — the middleware
  module docstring** said "No other behavior differs" after enumerating the two
  Python divergences, eliding the documented template-side third; reworded to
  scope "two narrow divergences" to the Python middleware and name the template's
  defensive-DOM guards as the third. **The spec opener** still read as "Planned for
  `0.0.14`" and carried its authoring-time status id, contradicting the
  `COMPLETE (DONE-042-0.0.14)` status; realigned to the shipped-spec convention
  (past tense + `DONE-` id), matching spec-040. The review's separate claim that
  the *unchecked implementation checklist* is itself a defect was **not adopted**:
  every shipped spec (e.g. spec-040) leaves its checklist unticked by convention
  — the `Status:` line is the completion source of truth — so only the
  contradictory opener was corrected.

## Key glossary references

Skim these [`docs/GLOSSARY.md`][glossary] entries first — they anchor the vocabulary
used throughout the spec:

- [Debug-toolbar middleware][glossary-debug-toolbar-middleware] — the subject.
  The glossary already pins the planned contract: `django-debug-toolbar`
  SQL-panel integration during `/graphql/` requests, mirroring
  `strawberry-django`'s `middlewares/debug_toolbar.py` shape, distinct from the
  in-response sibling. Slice 2 updates the entry body to the implemented
  contract (the status flip to `shipped (0.0.14)` rides the joint cut).
- [Response-extensions debug middleware][glossary-response-extensions-debug-middleware]
  — the sibling card ([`TODO-ALPHA-044-0.0.14`][kanban]) this card is
  **deliberately distinct from**: this card is the server-side toolbar panel
  UI; that card surfaces SQL / exceptions **inside** the GraphQL response's
  `extensions` map. Both useful, not mutually exclusive — the card body says so
  and this spec preserves the boundary
  ([Decision 2](#decision-2--card-scope-boundary-the-server-side-toolbar-integration-ships-the-in-response-surface-fakeshop-settings-opt-in-and-async-verification-stay-out)).
- [Soft dependency][glossary-soft-dependency] — the pattern this card
  instantiates a third time: one `require_*()` guard over the
  `utils/imports.py` optional-import owner, one install-hint constant,
  [eviction-simulated absence][glossary-eviction-simulated-absence] tests, and
  the dev-group + lockfile dependency gate. The lazy-resolution *mechanism*
  differs from the router's — see the next two entries.
- [PEP 562 lazy export][glossary-pep-562-lazy-export] — the router's
  lazy-symbol mechanism, cited here as the **contrast**: this card deliberately
  does NOT use it. The middleware module is a dedicated leaf whose import is
  itself the opt-in (the `rest_framework/` shape), so the guard runs at module
  import time
  ([Decision 5](#decision-5--soft-django-debug-toolbar-dependency-an-import-time-require_debug_toolbar-guard-the-rest_framework-shape)).
- [Eviction-simulated absence][glossary-eviction-simulated-absence] — the test
  discipline for the toolbar-absent path: strict `sys.modules` eviction with the
  **two-sided** (parent-attribute) restore, exactly the [`spec-041`][spec-041]
  refinement — but the absence itself is simulated with an importlib-compatible
  `sys.modules["debug_toolbar"] = None` sentinel, **not** the router/DRF
  `builtins.__import__` block, because the guard imports via `importlib`, which
  the block does not intercept (Decision 9, Revision 5).
- [`require_optional_module`][glossary-require-optional-module] — the raising
  optional-import primitive [`spec-041`][spec-041] Slice 1 landed in
  [`utils/imports.py`][utils-imports]; `require_debug_toolbar()` is a thin
  wrapper over it, never a fourth hand-rolled import pattern.
- [Joint version cut][glossary-joint-version-cut] — why no slice here bumps the
  version: the `0.0.14` line has two open siblings and one landed predecessor
  that already deferred; the last card to land owns the version quintet and the
  release-status flips
  ([Decision 10](#decision-10--version-bumps-are-owned-by-the-joint-0014-cut)).
- [Live-first coverage mandate][glossary-live-first-coverage-mandate] — the
  test-placement rule
  [Decision 9](#decision-9--test-strategy-package-tests-driving-real-in-process-fakeshop-requests-under-settings-overrides-eviction-simulated-absence)
  answers: the covering tests drive **real fakeshop `/graphql/` requests**, but
  they live in `tests/middleware/` because the middleware only exists in the
  request path under per-test settings overrides — fakeshop's shipped settings
  deliberately do not enable a soft-dependency middleware.
- [Schema reload discipline][glossary-schema-reload-discipline] — the fixture
  obligation Decision 9 inherits from the acceptance suites: package tests that
  execute real GraphQL through the aggregate fakeshop schema call the
  single-sited `schema_reload.reload_all_project_schemas()` on setup, before
  any URLconf step, so a prior package-test `registry.clear()` can never
  surface as an order-dependent `LazyType` `KeyError` / `DuplicatedTypeName`.
- [`seed_data`][glossary-seed-data] — the repo's seed-helper rule applied to
  the [Test plan](#test-plan): every product-query test's first executable
  line is `seed_data(1)` (or an explicit `seed_data(N)`) from
  `apps.products.services`, so the SQL-panel assertions ride real rows and
  real SQL.
- [Single-upstream parity][glossary-single-upstream-parity] — the card's
  Required 🍓 parity posture: `strawberry-graphql-django` ships the equivalent
  module, `graphene-django` ships none, and the card says so plainly instead
  of fabricating a second upstream — the same honesty
  [`spec-040`][spec-040] ([Auth mutations][glossary-auth-mutations]) and
  [`spec-041`][spec-041] recorded.
- [`DjangoGraphQLProtocolRouter`][glossary-djangographqlprotocolrouter] — the
  `0.0.14` predecessor whose soft-`channels` work built the guard primitive and
  the two-sided-restore test discipline this card reuses.
- [`SerializerMutation`][glossary-serializermutation] — the original
  soft-dependency precedent (`require_drf()`, the `_HINT_SUBSTRING` drift-check
  discipline, the import-time-guard-in-a-leaf-package shape this card's
  Decision 5 mirrors).
- [`TestClient`][glossary-testclient] / [`GraphQLTestCase`][glossary-graphqltestcase]
  — the `0.0.14` sibling card (`TODO-ALPHA-043-0.0.14`) whose helpers own
  HTTP-level test ergonomics; this card's tests use `django.test.Client`
  directly, as the whole suite does today.
- [`DjangoOptimizerExtension`][glossary-djangooptimizerextension] — untouched
  here, but the reason this card matters more for this package than for a
  generic GraphQL library: the SQL panel is how a developer *sees* the
  optimizer's `select_related` / `prefetch_related` / [`only()`
  projection][glossary-only-projection] plan as executed queries during a
  `/graphql/` request.
- [Django `AppConfig`][glossary-django-appconfig] — the shipped app config is
  what makes the template asset resolvable: consumers already list
  `"django_strawberry_framework"` in `INSTALLED_APPS`, so Django's app-dirs
  template loader finds the in-package
  `templates/django_strawberry_framework/debug_toolbar.html`
  ([Decision 4](#decision-4--module-template-and-test-locations-a-middleware-subpackage-an-in-package-template-asset-testsmiddleware)).
- [`ConfigurationError`][glossary-configurationerror] — NOT used by this card
  (worth saying explicitly): the failure mode here is a missing optional
  dependency at import time, which is `ImportError` with an install hint per
  the soft-dependency contract, not a configuration validation error.

## Slice checklist

Each top-level item maps to one commit / PR. **Two slices: the dependency gate +
code + template + tests (Slice 1), and docs + card wrap (Slice 2).** The card is
an M — the middleware is two overrides and a module-level helper (~100 lines
upstream including imports), the template is a ~45-line JS asset ported with the
render path renamed, and the weight is in the soft-dependency discipline and the
in-process fakeshop request tests.

- [ ] **Slice 1 — dependency gate + `middleware/debug_toolbar.py` + template +
  `tests/middleware/test_debug_toolbar.py`**
  - [ ] **The dependency gate lands first, in the same commit** (the
        [`spec-039`][spec-039] Slice-0 discipline): **`django-debug-toolbar>=7.0.0`**
        added to `[dependency-groups].dev` in [`pyproject.toml`][pyproject] and
        `uv.lock` regenerated together (`uv lock`), so the declared and locked
        dev environments never diverge. The floor is **`7.0.0` everywhere — one
        floor for the whole advertised Django range**: [`pyproject.toml`][pyproject]
        advertises `Framework :: Django :: 6.0`, and `7.0.0` is the first
        `django-debug-toolbar` release carrying the Django 6.0 classifier
        (PyPI metadata: `6.0.0`, 2025-07-25, classifies Django 4.2–5.2 only;
        `7.0.0` classifies 5.2 + 6.0 with `django>=5.2` and `python>=3.10` —
        both compatible with the package's own floors), so upstream's
        `django-debug-toolbar>=6.0.0` declaration is deliberately **not**
        copied: a `6.0.0` floor would let a Django 6.0 user follow the
        package's own install hint into an unsupported toolbar
        ([Decision 5](#decision-5--soft-django-debug-toolbar-dependency-an-import-time-require_debug_toolbar-guard-the-rest_framework-shape)).
        The implementation worker **records the exact pytest command** (e.g.
        `uv run pytest tests/middleware/test_debug_toolbar.py`) for the
        maintainer to run, and does not run the suite itself unless the
        maintainer explicitly authorizes pytest for this slice — the
        [`AGENTS.md`][agents] #"Do not run pytest" workflow rule; this spec
        describes the verification but does not override that rule. When the
        floor is checked, the three-places-that-must-agree rule applies — the
        dev-group specifier, the `_DEBUG_TOOLBAR_INSTALL_HINT` string, and the
        re-typed test literal all name the same floor.
  - [ ] **The Strawberry view-class gate rides the same commit**: confirm
        `strawberry.django.views.BaseView` (the `issubclass` target of
        [Decision 7](#decision-7--strawberry-view-detection-issubclass-against-strawberrydjangoviewsbaseview-engine-owned--resolving-the-cards-djangographqlview-hedge))
        is importable at the package's pinned `strawberry-graphql>=0.262.0`
        floor in an isolated throwaway venv (never the shared `.venv` — the
        [`spec-041`][spec-041] gate discipline); its presence at the installed
        strawberry 0.316.0 is verified now (`strawberry/django/views.py`
        defines `BaseView` with `GraphQLView` / `AsyncGraphQLView` both
        subclassing it), the floor-presence check is upstream history
        re-confirmed at the gate. If it is missing at the floor, bump the
        project's Strawberry floor instead. The command and outcome are
        recorded in the build artifact

        edit but cannot grant the permission.

## Problem statement

`django-debug-toolbar` is the standard dev-time window into a Django request:
which SQL ran, how long it took, what templates rendered, what signals fired. It
works by tracking a request through its middleware and rendering a per-request
panel UI into HTML responses. A GraphQL endpoint breaks both halves of that
contract: the interesting responses are JSON (an operation result has no HTML
body to inject a toolbar into), and the one HTML response the endpoint serves —
the GraphiQL IDE page — is loaded **once**, after which every query is a
`fetch()` the toolbar never sees. The result is the exact gap the card names:
`django-debug-toolbar`'s SQL panel captures nothing for `/graphql/` traffic, so
developers cannot see the queries their GraphQL selections trigger.

That gap matters more for this package than for a generic GraphQL library.
The package's headline claim — [`GOAL.md`][goal] success criterion 5, "rely
on automatic ORM optimization" — is that
[`DjangoOptimizerExtension`][glossary-djangooptimizerextension] turns nested
selections into one planned queryset — `select_related` joins, windowed
prefetches, [`only()` projections][glossary-only-projection], [FK-id
elision][glossary-fk-id-elision]. The SQL panel is how a developer *verifies*
that claim against their own schema during development: one look at the panel
after a `/graphql/` request shows whether the plan collapsed the N+1 or not.
Shipping the optimizer without the standard way to watch it work is an
observability hole in the package's own story.

`strawberry-graphql-django` closes the gap in
[`strawberry_django/middlewares/debug_toolbar.py`][upstream-middleware] (itself
based on the archived `django-graphiql-debug-toolbar` project, credited in its
header comment): a `DebugToolbarMiddleware` subclassing the stock toolbar
middleware, tagging Strawberry-Django-view requests in `process_view`, and
injecting a `debugToolbar` payload into the JSON responses those views return in
`_postprocess` — paired with a [template asset][upstream-template] that patches
the GraphiQL page's `JSON.parse` / `Response.json` so the toolbar's frontend
updates its panels from the injected payload after every query. The card
carries the Required 🍓 parity tag for exactly that module (the
[`KANBAN.md`][kanban] #"Decision: Alpha cards must claim upstream parity" rule;
`graphene-django` ships **no** equivalent — its debug story is the in-response
`DjangoDebug` subsystem tracked by the sibling card
[`TODO-ALPHA-044-0.0.14`][kanban] — so this is single-upstream parity, honest,
not fabricated).

The work is small — two overrides, one helper, one template — but it introduces
the package's **third soft dependency** (`django-debug-toolbar`, after
`djangorestframework` and `channels`), so the real design weight is in doing
that the way [`spec-039`][spec-039] and [`spec-041`][spec-041] already proved:
one guard, one install-hint string, a package import that never pays for the
integration it didn't ask for, and tests that simulate absence without
uninstalling anything.

## Current state

A true description of the repo as this spec is authored:

- **No `middleware/` subpackage exists; [`docs/TREE.md`][tree] reserves it.** The
  target package layout reserves `middleware/` for `DONE-042-0.0.14` (Debug-toolbar
  middleware) with `debug_toolbar.py` beneath it — this card's
  rows. The target test tree carries no `tests/middleware/` row yet (only the
  sibling card's `tests/extensions/`); the regenerated tree adds it in Slice 2.
- **The package ships no template directory.** `django_strawberry_framework/`
  has no `templates/`; this card creates it. The packaging side is already
  covered: [`pyproject.toml`][pyproject]'s hatchling wheel target packages the
  `django_strawberry_framework` directory wholesale, so an in-package template
  ships without a new build-config entry.
- **The package ships no view class.** There is no `DjangoGraphQLView` (the
  card's working name) anywhere in the package; the fakeshop example wires
  Strawberry's own `strawberry.django.views.GraphQLView` directly in
  [`examples/fakeshop/config/urls.py`][config-urls] (wrapped in
  `ensure_csrf_cookie`, with `graphql_ide="graphiql"`), and the installed
  strawberry 0.316.0 defines `BaseView` as the shared base of `GraphQLView`
  and `AsyncGraphQLView` ([`strawberry/django/views.py`][venv-strawberry-views]).
  This is the fact that resolves the card's view-detection hedge
  ([Decision 7](#decision-7--strawberry-view-detection-issubclass-against-strawberrydjangoviewsbaseview-engine-owned--resolving-the-cards-djangographqlview-hedge)).
- **`django-debug-toolbar` is absent at spec-authoring time.** As this spec is
  authored it is in neither `[project].dependencies` nor
  `[dependency-groups].dev` in [`pyproject.toml`][pyproject], and `import
  debug_toolbar` fails in the local dev environment (verified). Slice 1 changes
  the dev group and lockfile — so this is a point-in-time snapshot of the repo,
  not an invariant the rest of the spec relies on.
- **The soft-dependency architecture exists, twice-proven, with the shared
  primitive landed.** [`utils/imports.py`][utils-imports] ships
  [`require_optional_module(module_name, *, install_hint)`][glossary-require-optional-module]
  ([`spec-041`][spec-041] Slice 1) — `require_channels()` in
  [`routers.py`][routers] already rides it, and
  [`tests/rest_framework/test_soft_dependency.py`][test-soft-dependency] +
  `tests/test_routers.py` pin the two existing absence matrices with the
  [eviction-simulated][glossary-eviction-simulated-absence] discipline
  (including the two-sided parent-attribute restore this card's absence
  fixture copies).
- **The whole test suite already runs against fakeshop settings.**
  [`pytest.ini`][pytest-ini] sets `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = config.settings`
  with `pythonpath = examples/fakeshop`, so a root-`tests/` test can drive the
  real fakeshop `/graphql/` URLconf (GraphiQL page and products schema,
  real SQL) through `django.test.Client` — the vehicle
  [Decision 9](#decision-9--test-strategy-package-tests-driving-real-in-process-fakeshop-requests-under-settings-overrides-eviction-simulated-absence)
  uses. Fakeshop's shipped settings carry no `debug_toolbar` app and no toolbar
  middleware — and this card deliberately keeps it that way
  ([Decision 2](#decision-2--card-scope-boundary-the-server-side-toolbar-integration-ships-the-in-response-surface-fakeshop-settings-opt-in-and-async-verification-stay-out)).
- **The version line reads `0.0.13`, and the `0.0.14` joint cut is already in
  motion.** [`DONE-041-0.0.14`][kanban] landed with its version bump deferred;
  `TODO-ALPHA-043` / `044` are non-Done at this card's patch version, so the
  [joint-cut rule][glossary-joint-version-cut] applies
  ([Decision 10](#decision-10--version-bumps-are-owned-by-the-joint-0014-cut)).

## Goals

1. **Make the SQL panel see `/graphql/` traffic.** With the middleware wired, a
   developer running the toolbar sees, for every GraphQL operation issued from
   GraphiQL, the toolbar panels update in place — the SQL panel carrying the
   queries that operation triggered, which for this package means the
   [`DjangoOptimizerExtension`][glossary-djangooptimizerextension] plan as
   actually executed
   ([Decision 6](#decision-6--subclass-and-override-borrowed-as-is-process_view--_postprocess-_get_payload-_html_types)).
2. **Keep `django-debug-toolbar` soft.** `import django_strawberry_framework`
   (and `from django_strawberry_framework import *`) must succeed and stay
   toolbar-free; the install-hint `ImportError` fires only when the consumer
   actually imports the middleware module — which is what Django's `MIDDLEWARE`
   setting does at startup, so a consumer who lists the dotted path without the
   dependency gets one actionable error naming the floor
   ([Decision 5](#decision-5--soft-django-debug-toolbar-dependency-an-import-time-require_debug_toolbar-guard-the-rest_framework-shape)).
3. **One-line migration.** A `strawberry-graphql-django` migrant changes exactly
   one settings string —
   `"strawberry_django.middlewares.debug_toolbar.DebugToolbarMiddleware"` →
   `"django_strawberry_framework.middleware.debug_toolbar.DebugToolbarMiddleware"` —
   with zero behavior change (same class name, same overrides, same template
   mechanism), and the rename is recorded for the migration guide's
   symbol-equivalents table
   ([Decision 3](#decision-3--the-symbol-is-debugtoolbarmiddleware--same-class-name-distinctly-ours-dotted-path)).
   This is [`GOAL.md`][goal] success criterion 7 — migrate "without bringing
   the source package along … only the import line changes" — applied to a
   settings dotted path, the middleware's equivalent of an import line.
4. **Both dependency states tested, against real requests.** The
   toolbar-present tests drive the real fakeshop GraphiQL page and a real
   SQL-emitting products query through `django.test.Client`; the toolbar-absent
   path pins the guarded `ImportError`. The package coverage gate
   (`fail_under = 100`) holds with `middleware/debug_toolbar.py` included
   ([Decision 9](#decision-9--test-strategy-package-tests-driving-real-in-process-fakeshop-requests-under-settings-overrides-eviction-simulated-absence)).
5. **Own nothing the toolbar already owns.** No panel logic, no request
   tracking, no toolbar configuration surface — the package contributes the
   GraphQL-shaped injection points and nothing else, so toolbar upgrades keep
   working through the stock machinery
   ([Decision 6](#decision-6--subclass-and-override-borrowed-as-is-process_view--_postprocess-_get_payload-_html_types)).

## Non-goals

- **The in-response debug surface.** Surfacing SQL / exceptions inside the
  GraphQL response's `extensions` map is the sibling card
  [`TODO-ALPHA-044-0.0.14`][kanban]
  ([Response-extensions debug middleware][glossary-response-extensions-debug-middleware])
  — graphene-django parity, a Strawberry `SchemaExtension`, no toolbar
  involved. The two are complementary by design; nothing in this card reads or
  writes `extensions`.
- **Wiring the toolbar into fakeshop's shipped settings.** The example's
  runtime path stays free of soft dependencies (the [`spec-041`][spec-041]
  posture for `channels`, applied again): no `debug_toolbar` in fakeshop's
  `INSTALLED_APPS`, no middleware entry, no `INTERNAL_IPS`. The tests wire it
  per-test via settings overrides
  ([Decision 9](#decision-9--test-strategy-package-tests-driving-real-in-process-fakeshop-requests-under-settings-overrides-eviction-simulated-absence));
  a dev-ergonomics opt-in in the example (a `DEBUG`-gated conditional settings
  block) is a maintainer call for the fakeshop-activation card
  ([`TODO-BETA-053-0.1.5`][kanban]) if wanted at all.
- **A package view class.** The Strawberry-view detection targets Strawberry's
  engine-owned `BaseView`
  ([Decision 7](#decision-7--strawberry-view-detection-issubclass-against-strawberrydjangoviewsbaseview-engine-owned--resolving-the-cards-djangographqlview-hedge));
  shipping a `DjangoGraphQLView` wrapper just to have a package-owned
  `issubclass` target would be surface for surface's sake. If the package ever
  ships its own view, that card updates the one `issubclass` line.
- **Toolbar configuration passthrough.** `DEBUG_TOOLBAR_CONFIG`,
  `SHOW_TOOLBAR_CALLBACK`, panel selection, and `INTERNAL_IPS` are
  `django-debug-toolbar`'s own settings surface and remain the consumer's
  business; the middleware inherits whatever the stock middleware reads. No new
  package settings key — [`conf.py`][conf] is untouched (the [`START.md`][start]
  rule: add a settings key only when the feature that needs it lands; none does).
- **A hard `django-debug-toolbar` dependency, or an extras group.**
  `[project].dependencies` is untouched; no
  `django-strawberry-framework[debug-toolbar]` extra (upstream ships one, but
  the package's DRF and channels precedents both rejected extras — an extra
  changes how consumers install, not whether the import needs guarding; rejected
  again in
  [Decision 5](#decision-5--soft-django-debug-toolbar-dependency-an-import-time-require_debug_toolbar-guard-the-rest_framework-shape)).
- **Async-path verification.** The stock toolbar middleware is async-capable
  and the subclass inherits that; but the package's own test vehicle (fakeshop)
  is WSGI/sync, and this card asserts nothing about the toolbar under
  `AsyncGraphQLView` or ASGI — recorded honestly in
  [Risks](#risks-and-open-questions), not implied.

## Borrowing posture

Per the [`START.md`][start] "do both libraries provide it?" test this card is
**single-upstream parity**: `strawberry-graphql-django` ships
[`middlewares/debug_toolbar.py`][upstream-middleware] + its
[template asset][upstream-template]; `graphene-django` ships no toolbar
integration (its debug story is the in-response `DjangoDebug` subsystem — the
sibling card's territory). The card's `Verified in upstream` section names the
two upstream files and both were read in full for this spec; the upstream module
is 101 lines and every behavior below is taken from it directly, not from
memory. Upstream's own header credits `django-graphiql-debug-toolbar` (the
archived origin project) — the lineage is toolbar-side, not GraphQL-side, which
is consistent with the module's shape: everything hard lives in
`django-debug-toolbar`; the integration is two overrides.

### From `strawberry-graphql-django` — borrow the mechanism, verbatim

[`middlewares/debug_toolbar.py`][upstream-middleware] is, in full:

- **`_HTML_TYPES = {"text/html", "application/xhtml+xml"}`** — the
  content-type sniff set for the HTML injection path.
- **`_get_payload(request, response, toolbar) -> dict | None`** — module-level
  helper: bail (`None`) when the toolbar assigned no `request_id`; otherwise
  decode the JSON response body (`force_str` with the response charset,
  `object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict`), **bail (`None`) again if the decoded body is
  not a mapping** (the P2.3 guard — see below), attach
  `payload["debugToolbar"] = {"panels": {...}, "requestId": toolbar.request_id}`,
  and fill `panels` from `reversed(toolbar.enabled_panels)` with each panel's
  `title` (only when `panel.has_content`, called if callable) and
  `nav_subtitle` (called if callable), **skipping `TemplatesPanel`** (its
  content churns per request and floods the payload). The non-mapping bail is
  the card's second deliberate divergence from upstream (which does
  `payload = json.loads(...)` then `payload["debugToolbar"] = ...` assuming a
  dict): a valid single GraphQL response is always a JSON object, but a
  malformed test view or a future batch-response shape could decode to a list or
  scalar, and without the guard the subscript-assign raises and this dev-only
  tool turns an unusual response into a 500. `if not isinstance(payload, dict):
  return None` keeps the toolbar silent on such responses instead. Test 14
  pins it.
- **`DebugToolbarMiddleware(debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware)`**
  with exactly two methods:
  - `process_view` — `request._is_graphiql = isinstance(view, type) and
    issubclass(view, BaseView)` where `view = getattr(view_func, "view_class",
    None)` and `BaseView` is `strawberry.django.views.BaseView`. The
    `isinstance(view, type)` guard is a deliberate, narrow divergence from
    upstream's `bool(view and issubclass(...))` — see
    [Decision 7](#decision-7--strawberry-view-detection-issubclass-against-strawberrydjangoviewsbaseview-engine-owned--resolving-the-cards-djangographqlview-hedge).
  - `_postprocess` (decorated `@override`) — call `super()._postprocess(...)`
    first (the stock toolbar does its own work: handle insertion into the
    GraphiQL HTML page, history tracking); return early for
    `response.streaming`; sniff `Content-Type` (first segment); **HTML path**:
    when HTML + Strawberry-view-tagged (`_is_graphiql`) + status 200, `render_to_string` the template
    asset, `response.write(template)`, refresh `Content-Length` if present;
    **JSON path**: when the request is Strawberry-view-tagged and the content type is
    `application/json`, read `operationName` from `json.loads(request.body)`
    (any exception → `None`), skip the payload entirely for
    `"IntrospectionQuery"`, else `_get_payload(...)` and re-encode the body
    with `json.dumps(payload, cls=DjangoJSONEncoder)` + `Content-Length`
    refresh.
- **The [template asset][upstream-template]** — a `<script>` appended to the
  GraphiQL HTML page that patches `JSON.parse` and `Response.prototype.json`:
  every JSON body the IDE decodes is passed through `update(data)`, which — when
  a `debugToolbar` key is present — writes the panel titles / subtitles into
  the already-rendered toolbar DOM, resets each updated panel's content area to
  a loader (the panel body is re-fetched lazily by the stock toolbar JS via the
  `data-request-id`), sets that `data-request-id` attribute on `djDebug` (via
  `setAttribute`), deletes the `debugToolbar` key, and returns the cleaned data
  so GraphiQL renders the response unpolluted.

The mechanism is borrowed as-is
([Decision 6](#decision-6--subclass-and-override-borrowed-as-is-process_view--_postprocess-_get_payload-_html_types));
the deltas are the module path, the template's render path
(`django_strawberry_framework/debug_toolbar.html`), the soft-dependency guard
upstream does not need, and the documented robustness divergences (two
Python-middleware, plus the template-side guard family — all enumerated below).

**Template-port checklist.** Because the asset is JavaScript and the package
test suite has no JS runtime, the port is a behavior-preserving copy verified
against upstream by diff, not by execution. The reviewable invariants a diff
against [upstream's template][upstream-template] must preserve — each also
pinned mechanically as a substring/pattern check by the [Test plan](#test-plan)'s
template-port guard (Test 16), so the list is not protected by visual review
alone:

- the `JSON.parse` wrapper is preserved (in the hardened form below, not
  upstream's verbatim `function (text)`);
- the `Response.prototype.json` wrapper is preserved;
- `delete data.debugToolbar` (the key is stripped before the IDE renders) is
  preserved;
- the `data-request-id` update on `#djDebug` (via `setAttribute`) is preserved;
- the per-panel title / subtitle DOM updates are preserved.

**Documented robustness divergences (the card's third divergence, template-side;
Revisions 7–8).** Upstream's hook is a verbatim borrow that is unsafe as a
*global* patch, in the same "a dev-only tool that patches a global must neither
corrupt nor crash unrelated page code" class the middleware's other two
divergences address. Once `update` is wired into the page-wide `JSON.parse` /
`Response.prototype.json`, the guiding rule is **payload scrubbing is mandatory
and DOM updates are best-effort**. The port diverges from the borrow in four
spots, all serving that rule:

- **Reviver preservation (Rev 7).** Upstream's `JSON.parse = function (text) {
  return update(origParse(text)); }` drops the standard second `reviver`
  argument, so every page-wide `JSON.parse(text, reviver)` silently loses its
  reviver while GraphiQL is open — the port forwards every argument via
  `JSON.parse = function () { return update(origParse.apply(this, arguments)); }`.
- **Membership-guard safety (Rev 7).** Upstream's
  `!data.hasOwnProperty("debugToolbar")` guard throws for a null-prototype object
  (`Object.create(null)`) or one that shadows `hasOwnProperty` — the port's
  `update` bails on `data === null`, `typeof data !== "object"`, and
  `!Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(data, "debugToolbar")`.
- **Mandatory scrub before the null-handle bail (Rev 8).** The port captures the
  `debugToolbar` payload and `delete`s the key *before* the
  `if (djDebug === null) return data;` guard, so a page whose toolbar DOM did not
  render still returns a scrubbed GraphQL payload instead of leaking the
  server-only key back to GraphiQL. (Rev 7 added the `djDebug === null` guard for
  crash-avoidance but returned *before* the scrub; Rev 8 makes the scrub
  unconditional.)
- **Best-effort per-panel DOM (Rev 8).** The panel loop is a side-effect-only
  `forEach` that skips a panel whose content node is absent (`content === null`)
  and writes the nav subtitle only when the nav item exists, so a panel present
  in the payload but missing from the current toolbar DOM cannot throw inside the
  patched `JSON.parse` / `Response.prototype.json` and break the IDE response
  path.

The DOM-update body is otherwise upstream's: the asset is a single `<script>`
IIFE with **no Django template tags at all** — no `{% load %}`, no `{% static %}`,
no `{% url %}`, and no pre-existing header comment to adapt. The only renamed
path in this card is the `render_to_string(...)` argument in the middleware,
which is not in the asset. Test 16 pins both the preserved invariants and the
diverged forms (including the scrub-before-bail ordering) so none can silently
regress.

### Explicitly do not borrow

- **The hard `debug_toolbar` import.** Upstream imports `debug_toolbar.*` at
  module top level unguarded — it can afford to because its `debug-toolbar`
  extra and its docs gate who imports the module. This package's floor is
  "importable with zero optional dependencies", proven twice; the import stays
  at module top level (the class body needs it) but runs **behind the guard**
  ([Decision 5](#decision-5--soft-django-debug-toolbar-dependency-an-import-time-require_debug_toolbar-guard-the-rest_framework-shape)).
- **The `middlewares/` (plural) package name.** [`docs/TREE.md`][tree]'s target
  layout reserved `middleware/` (singular) against this card before this spec
  was authored, and the package's own subpackage names are singular-noun
  subsystems (`optimizer/`, `auth/`, `testing/`). Documented divergence, zero
  consumer impact — consumers type the dotted path once
  ([Decision 4](#decision-4--module-template-and-test-locations-a-middleware-subpackage-an-in-package-template-asset-testsmiddleware)).
- **Upstream's dependency floor.** `django-debug-toolbar>=6.0.0` is upstream's
  declaration; `6.0.0` predates the Django 6.0 classifier this package
  advertises, so the package's floor is `>=7.0.0`
  ([Decision 5](#decision-5--soft-django-debug-toolbar-dependency-an-import-time-require_debug_toolbar-guard-the-rest_framework-shape)).
- **The `typing_extensions.override` decorator.** Upstream decorates
  `_postprocess` with `@override` from `typing_extensions`; the package does
  not depend on `typing_extensions` directly and its floor is Python 3.10
  (`typing.override` arrives in 3.12), so the override intent is carried by the
  docstring and the test suite instead of a decorator import the package would
  add a dependency for.

## User-facing API

The consumer's setup is the toolbar's own **three** standard pieces — app,
middleware, URLconf (the shape of the toolbar's own
[installation docs][debug-toolbar-install-docs]) — with one package-specific swap (the package middleware
**replaces** the stock `debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware` entry,
exactly as upstream's does — it subclasses it, so listing both would run the
toolbar twice). All three pieces are load-bearing, and omitting the URLconf
fails **loudly, on every toolbar-processed request** — not quietly at
panel-click time: the stock `_postprocess` renders the toolbar
**unconditionally** for every response it processes, HTML and JSON alike
(7.0.0's "Always render the toolbar for the history panel" line), and that
render reverses `djdt:` routes inside `debug_toolbar/base.html`
(`{% url 'djdt:render_panel' %}`). `render_toolbar`'s `except` catches only
`TemplateSyntaxError`, so with the `djdt` namespace unregistered the very
first GraphiQL GET or tagged JSON POST dies with `NoReverseMatch` (under
`DEBUG=True`, the Django error page). The toolbar surfaces a missing URLconf
at **request time**, not via a startup system check: no general system check
fires for a `DEBUG=True` dev who omits `debug_toolbar_urls()` (the one check
keyed on `show_toolbar_changed and not toolbar_urls_installed`, `apps.py`'s
`E001`, is scoped to test runs — `not settings.DEBUG and IS_RUNNING_TESTS` —
and reports "The Django Debug Toolbar can't be used with tests", not a missing
URLconf). The dev-time signal is the `NoReverseMatch` above. The support-facing
consequence: "I added the middleware and my whole GraphQL endpoint 500s"
means the URLconf step was skipped.

Omitting the **app** fails even earlier and just as loudly: the package
middleware's module import defines a Django model (`debug_toolbar` ships
`HistoryEntry`), so with `"debug_toolbar"` absent from `INSTALLED_APPS` the leaf
raises `ImproperlyConfigured` naming the missing app at import (server boot /
`MIDDLEWARE` resolution) — the package's own wiring gate
(`apps.is_installed("debug_toolbar")`), in place of Django's cryptic
`HistoryEntry` app-label `RuntimeError` ([Error shapes](#error-shapes)). The
support-facing consequence: "the server won't start after I added the
middleware" means the `INSTALLED_APPS` step was skipped.

```python
# settings.py — dev only, the standard django-debug-toolbar setup
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    "django_strawberry_framework",   # already present: the package's AppConfig
    "debug_toolbar",
]

MIDDLEWARE = [
    # The toolbar middleware goes as early as possible — after any
    # response-encoding middleware (e.g. GZipMiddleware) so it sees decoded
    # bodies, before everything else. Use the package class INSTEAD OF
    # "debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware" — never both (it
    # subclasses the stock one; listing both runs the toolbar twice).
    "django_strawberry_framework.middleware.debug_toolbar.DebugToolbarMiddleware",
    # ... your other middleware ...
]

INTERNAL_IPS = ["127.0.0.1"]
```

```python
# urls.py — the third standard piece: the toolbar's panel-content routes.
from debug_toolbar.toolbar import debug_toolbar_urls

urlpatterns = [
    # ... your GraphQL / admin / app routes ...
] + debug_toolbar_urls()   # DEBUG-gated: returns [] when DEBUG is False
```

Consumer-visible behavior:

- **The GraphiQL page carries the toolbar.** A GET of the GraphQL endpoint
  (the GraphiQL IDE HTML) renders with the stock toolbar handle — that part is
  the stock middleware's own work — plus the package's appended script asset.
- **Every GraphQL JSON response gets the panel payload — and the injection is
  view-scoped, not IDE-scoped.** This is the one contract subtlety worth stating
  plainly: the borrowed gate marks a request when its resolved view is a
  Strawberry Django view (`issubclass(view, BaseView)`), **not** when the
  request came from the GraphiQL IDE. So while the toolbar is enabled, *every*
  JSON response from that view — the IDE's own `fetch`, but equally a
  programmatic `POST /graphql/` from an API client, `curl`, a Django test, or
  frontend code — receives the extra top-level `debugToolbar` key (panel titles
  / subtitles + the toolbar `requestId`), unless skipped by the introspection
  rule below. The appended template strips the key **only in the GraphiQL page**
  where that script has run — updating the toolbar DOM and hiding the key from
  the IDE's response pane; a non-IDE client that does not load the template sees
  the raw extra key. This is verbatim upstream behavior (the
  `strawberry-graphql-django` port has the same side effect), accepted as the
  price of the one-settings-string migration
  ([Decision 6](#decision-6--subclass-and-override-borrowed-as-is-process_view--_postprocess-_get_payload-_html_types)).
  Clicking a panel in the IDE lazily fetches its full content from the toolbar's
  panel routes ([`debug_toolbar_urls()`](#user-facing-api)) via the request id —
  SQL, timing, everything the stock toolbar records.
- **Introspection is skipped.** GraphiQL and IDE tooling poll
  `IntrospectionQuery` constantly; a JSON response whose `operationName` is
  `"IntrospectionQuery"` is left untouched so the toolbar's request history is
  not flooded
  ([Decision 8](#decision-8--the-introspection-query-skip-is-preserved-verbatim)).
- **Non-GraphQL traffic is untouched.** The overrides tag only requests whose
  resolved view is a Strawberry Django view; everything else flows through the
  stock middleware behavior unchanged.
- **Production inertness is the toolbar's own.** The stock middleware disables
  itself unless the resolved show-toolbar callback allows the request; the
  default gate returns `False` when `settings.DEBUG` is false and otherwise
  only when `REMOTE_ADDR` is in `INTERNAL_IPS` (verified in
  `debug_toolbar.middleware.show_toolbar` at 7.0.0 — `DEBUG` is the first,
  decisive check). The subclass changes none of that gating.
- **Migration is the one settings string:**

  ```diff
  MIDDLEWARE = [
  -    "strawberry_django.middlewares.debug_toolbar.DebugToolbarMiddleware",
  +    "django_strawberry_framework.middleware.debug_toolbar.DebugToolbarMiddleware",
  ]
  ```

- **Without `django-debug-toolbar` installed**, the settings entry (or any
  direct `import django_strawberry_framework.middleware.debug_toolbar`) raises
  `ImportError` at Django startup with the install hint naming the verified
  floor — at the first moment the integration is actually reached for, never at
  `import django_strawberry_framework`.

### Error shapes

- **`django-debug-toolbar` absent** — `ImportError` from the module import,
  message naming the package and floor (working text, single-sited in
  `_DEBUG_TOOLBAR_INSTALL_HINT`): `"DebugToolbarMiddleware requires
  django-debug-toolbar, which is not installed. Install it with `pip install
  'django-debug-toolbar>=7.0.0'` (the package's verified debug-toolbar
  floor)."` — the exact wording mirrors the DRF / channels hints so the three
  soft dependencies fail identically. The hint is public API in practice — it
  is the error a deploying consumer follows — so it names the **one** floor
  that covers the package's whole advertised Django range (through 6.0)
  ([Decision 5](#decision-5--soft-django-debug-toolbar-dependency-an-import-time-require_debug_toolbar-guard-the-rest_framework-shape)).
  `require_debug_toolbar()` runs first and imports **only the top-level
  `debug_toolbar` package** (`require_optional_module("debug_toolbar", …)`), so
  it catches — and routes through the single hint, original `ImportError`
  chained (`__cause__`) — both a true absence **and** any `ImportError` raised
  while importing `debug_toolbar/__init__.py` itself, including a missing
  transitive dependency of the toolbar. That is acceptable here because the
  toolbar's `__init__` is lightweight (a version string and a couple of
  re-exports); if a future toolbar release grew a heavy `__init__` with its own
  optional imports, a genuine transitive failure would be mis-hinted as "not
  installed", and the guard would need widening — noted so the trade-off is
  explicit, not silent.
- **Present-but-broken installs** — `require_debug_toolbar()` passes (the
  top-level package imports) but a **class-body submodule import** then fails
  (`debug_toolbar.middleware` / `debug_toolbar.toolbar` / `strawberry.django.views`
  reshaped or half-installed). The guard does **not** cover these — it imported
  only the top-level package — so the raw `ImportError` propagates unwrapped,
  naming the real missing module, which is already actionable
  (`debug_toolbar.middleware` can only mean the toolbar install). Unlike the
  router's two-package boundary ([`spec-041`][spec-041] split messages), no
  second wrap message is added; the split there existed because the router's
  builder imported from two packages, whereas here the only wrapped import is
  the single top-level package. The [Test plan](#test-plan) still pins the
  degraded path so the propagation shape is contractual, not accidental.
- **`django-debug-toolbar` installed but `"debug_toolbar"` absent from
  `INSTALLED_APPS`** — a distinct, common misconfiguration (as likely as a
  forgotten `debug_toolbar_urls()`): `require_debug_toolbar()` passes (the
  top-level package imports), but the `debug_toolbar.middleware` import below
  reaches `debug_toolbar.models.HistoryEntry` (via `debug_toolbar.store`), and
  **defining a Django model whose app is not installed** raises Django's
  `RuntimeError` naming `HistoryEntry` — never the missing app, so it is *not*
  self-actionable (unlike the broken-install `ImportError` above, which names the
  real module). The leaf therefore adds a **second wiring gate** immediately
  after the package guard: `apps.is_installed("debug_toolbar")` (the app registry
  is ready by the time Django's `MIDDLEWARE` resolution imports the leaf), which
  raises the single `ImproperlyConfigured` carried in `_DEBUG_TOOLBAR_APP_HINT`
  and names the fix. This is the one place the card diverges from a pure
  `ImportError` error model — an `INSTALLED_APPS` omission is a settings error
  and `ImproperlyConfigured` is Django's idiom for it; the earlier "top-level
  package only" scope governs `require_debug_toolbar()`'s *import* guard, a
  separate concern from this *wiring* gate. The [Test plan](#test-plan) pins the
  shape (toolbar importable, app omitted, `ImproperlyConfigured` asserted).
- **Middleware listed but the view never matches** (a consumer whose GraphQL
  view is not a Strawberry Django view — a hand-rolled view, or an
  ASGI-consumer-only deployment) — not an error: `_is_graphiql` stays `False`,
  the overrides pass everything through, and the stock toolbar behavior is all
  that remains. The GLOSSARY body documents the detection contract so this
  reads as designed behavior, not silence.
- **A GraphQL JSON response whose media type is not `application/json`** — the
  JSON-injection path keys on `Content-Type == "application/json"` exactly as
  upstream does, so a response served as `application/graphql-response+json`
  (the GraphQL-over-HTTP "watershed" media type) is **not** injected. This is
  **in scope as a documented non-goal, not a defect** (P2.2): Strawberry's
  Django view returns `application/json` today, so the card matches upstream and
  does not diverge for a media type the engine does not yet emit. Broadening the
  sniff to a `{"application/json", "application/graphql-response+json"}` set is a
  clean follow-up compatibility card if/when Strawberry emits the newer type;
  pinning the decision here keeps the gap explicit rather than a silent future
  regression. (Contrast the divergences the card *does* take — the `isinstance`
  and non-mapping guards, plus the template hook's reviver-preserving /
  safe-membership form — which prevent crashes rather than add a speculative
  feature.)
- **A strict Content Security Policy on the GraphiQL page** — the HTML path
  appends an inline `<script>` (the ported bridge asset) to the GraphiQL
  response, matching upstream and its `django-graphiql-debug-toolbar` lineage. A
  strict CSP without an `unsafe-inline` / matching hash for that script will
  **block it**: the server-side toolbar history still records, but the GraphiQL
  page will not consume or strip the `debugToolbar` key from JSON responses, so
  a non-IDE client watching that endpoint could observe the extra top-level
  `debugToolbar` key. Dev-only, but real; the Slice-2 GLOSSARY / user-facing
  note must say a CSP consumer has to allow the toolbar script path or accept
  that the GraphiQL DOM updates will not run (P2.4).

## Architectural decisions

### Decision 1 — Spec filename and canonical naming

This spec lives at `docs/spec-042-debug_toolbar-0_0_14.md`: card NNN `042`, topic
slug `debug_toolbar` (the card's subject), version segment `0_0_14` from the
card's trailing `-0.0.14`. Follows the [`docs/SPECS/NEXT.md`][next] convention.

Alternatives considered (and rejected):

- **`spec-042-debug_toolbar_middleware-0_0_14.md`.** Rejected: the `_middleware`
  suffix adds length without disambiguation — no other card touches the debug
  toolbar, and the sibling debug card ([`TODO-ALPHA-044-0.0.14`][kanban]) is
  named by its own distinct subject (response extensions), so `debug_toolbar`
  alone is unambiguous. Precedent favors the shorter slug
  (`channels_router`, `auth_mutations`, not `channels_asgi_router_module`).
- **`spec-042-django_debug_toolbar-0_0_14.md`.** Rejected: the `django_` prefix
  restates the ecosystem every card lives in; the package's own module path
  (`middleware/debug_toolbar.py`) uses the short form.

### Decision 2 — Card-scope boundary: the server-side toolbar integration ships; the in-response surface, fakeshop settings opt-in, and async verification stay out

This card ships exactly the card's DoD: the middleware module, the template
asset, the soft dependency, and the two test paths. Four adjacent-looking pieces
of work are explicitly out:

- **The in-response `extensions["debug"]` surface.** That is the sibling card
  [`TODO-ALPHA-044-0.0.14`][kanban]
  ([Response-extensions debug middleware][glossary-response-extensions-debug-middleware]),
  graphene-django parity with a completely different mechanism (a Strawberry
  `SchemaExtension`, no toolbar, no template). The card bodies of both cards
  name each other as "distinct from"; blending them here would entangle two
  parity stories with different upstreams. The one deliberate touch point:
  Slice 2's GLOSSARY body-edit keeps the two entries' "distinct from"
  cross-links accurate.
- **Fakeshop settings opt-in.** The example's shipped runtime stays free of
  soft dependencies (the [`spec-041`][spec-041] `channels` posture): wiring
  `debug_toolbar` into fakeshop's `INSTALLED_APPS` / `MIDDLEWARE` — even
  `DEBUG`-gated — would make the example's `manage.py runserver` path require
  an optional package the moment a developer flips `DEBUG`. The tests wire the
  middleware per-test instead
  ([Decision 9](#decision-9--test-strategy-package-tests-driving-real-in-process-fakeshop-requests-under-settings-overrides-eviction-simulated-absence));
  a dogfooding opt-in belongs to the fakeshop-activation card
  ([`TODO-BETA-053-0.1.5`][kanban]) if the maintainer wants it.
- **Not a Channels / ASGI toolbar integration.** Three precise statements, so
  "Django served under ASGI" is never conflated with "Channels consumer
  traffic": (1) the **tested contract** is sync Django test-client traffic
  through fakeshop's `GraphQLView` — a Django **HTTP middleware** wrapping
  Strawberry's **Django views**; (2) a Django `ASGIHandler` deployment that
  runs the normal Django middleware chain **may be structurally compatible** —
  the stock toolbar middleware has been async-capable since its 4.x line and
  the subclass inherits `async_capable` — but this card does not verify it and
  claims nothing about it ([Risks](#risks-and-open-questions)); (3) **Channels
  consumers are out of scope entirely**: this is not an integration for the
  [`DjangoGraphQLProtocolRouter`][glossary-djangographqlprotocolrouter] Channels
  transport that landed in the same `0.0.14` line ([`spec-041`][spec-041]) —
  `django-debug-toolbar`'s own documentation calls out async limitations and
  states Channels is not supported, a Django HTTP middleware never runs in a
  Channels consumer's ASGI path, and the router is not expected to run this
  middleware.
- **No new `Meta` / settings key.** The middleware is configured where every
  Django middleware is configured — the `MIDDLEWARE` list — and the toolbar is
  configured where the toolbar documents (`DEBUG_TOOLBAR_CONFIG`). Nothing
  reads [`conf.py`][conf]; `DEFERRED_META_KEYS` is untouched. The
  [`START.md`][start] rule ("add a settings key only when the feature that
  needs it lands") — no feature here needs one.

Justification: the card body pins the boundary itself ("Both mechanisms are
useful and not mutually exclusive" on the sibling; "developer experience" /
"Single module + tests" on scope), and the [`START.MD`][start] advice ("resist
scope creep... don't quietly mix in while-I'm-here extras") applies verbatim.

Alternatives considered (and rejected):

- **Fold both debug cards into one spec.** Rejected: different upstreams
  (🍓-only vs ⚛️-only), different mechanisms (Django HTTP middleware vs
  Strawberry `SchemaExtension`), different module homes (`middleware/` vs
  `extensions/`), and the board deliberately tracks them as two cards with
  "distinct from" edges. A joint spec would re-litigate the board.
- **Add the fakeshop `DEBUG`-gated toolbar block now for dogfooding.**
  Rejected: it drags a soft dependency into the example's runtime path and adds
  a settings branch the live acceptance suite never exercises (tests run
  `DEBUG=False`); dead weight until a deliberate dogfooding pass owns it.

### Decision 3 — The symbol is `DebugToolbarMiddleware` — same class name, distinctly-ours dotted path

The class is named `DebugToolbarMiddleware`, matching both upstream's subclass
**and** the stock `django-debug-toolbar` class it extends. This looks like it
contradicts the [`spec-041`][spec-041] Decision 3 "distinctly-ours symbol name"
posture; it does not, because the two surfaces have different identity
mechanics. A router class is *imported by name* in consumer code
(`from ... import DjangoGraphQLProtocolRouter`) — the name is the API. A Django
middleware is *referenced by dotted settings string* —
`"django_strawberry_framework.middleware.debug_toolbar.DebugToolbarMiddleware"` —
so the module path IS the distinctly-ours identity, and the class name is a
Django-ecosystem convention (`SessionMiddleware`, `AuthenticationMiddleware`,
`DebugToolbarMiddleware`) that consumers pattern-match, not a namespace anyone
imports across packages. Upstream made the same call for the same reason: its
class is also named `DebugToolbarMiddleware`, distinguished from the stock one
purely by module path. The card's own DoD pre-pins the name ("exposing a
`DebugToolbarMiddleware`"); this decision preserves it and adds the reasoning.

No package-root re-export, and no `middleware/__init__.py` re-export either:
the consumer surface is the full dotted path in a settings string, mirroring
the structural-opt-in posture ([`spec-040`][spec-040] Decision 3 /
[`spec-041`][spec-041] Decision 3) — a consumer who never uses the toolbar
never types the path, and [`__init__.py`][init]'s `__all__` stays
toolbar-free by construction. The module needs no `__all__` gymnastics and no
`# noqa: F822`: unlike the router's [PEP 562 lazy
export][glossary-pep-562-lazy-export], `DebugToolbarMiddleware` is a real
module global once the module imports
([Decision 5](#decision-5--soft-django-debug-toolbar-dependency-an-import-time-require_debug_toolbar-guard-the-rest_framework-shape)).

Alternatives considered (and rejected):

- **A distinctly-ours class name (`DjangoStrawberryDebugToolbarMiddleware`,
  `GraphQLDebugToolbarMiddleware`).** Rejected: the settings string already
  carries full provenance; a novel class name buys nothing a consumer sees
  (nobody imports the class) while breaking the ecosystem naming convention
  and making the migration diff noisier than one path segment.
- **Re-exporting from `middleware/__init__.py`
  (`django_strawberry_framework.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware`).**
  Rejected: it would force the `__init__.py` to import the guarded module —
  making `import django_strawberry_framework.middleware` itself raise on a
  toolbar-less machine and breaking whole-package walkers (the
  [`docs/TREE.md`][tree] renderer, coverage collection) for zero consumer
  benefit; the settings string is typed once either way.

### Decision 4 — Module, template, and test locations: a `middleware/` subpackage, an in-package template asset, `tests/middleware/`

The module is `django_strawberry_framework/middleware/debug_toolbar.py` — a
`middleware/` **subpackage** with one leaf module, not a top-level
`middleware.py`. Three reasons: the card's predicted-files list and
[`docs/TREE.md`][tree]'s target layout both reserve exactly this path (a shipped
commitment in the docs); the leaf-module shape is what makes the import-time
guard clean (the subpackage `__init__.py` stays empty-and-importable while the
leaf is the opt-in — the `rest_framework/` precedent,
[Decision 5](#decision-5--soft-django-debug-toolbar-dependency-an-import-time-require_debug_toolbar-guard-the-rest_framework-shape));
and upstream uses the same package-with-leaf shape (`middlewares/debug_toolbar.py`).
The package name is **singular** `middleware/` where upstream is plural —
[`docs/TREE.md`][tree] reserved the singular before this spec, and the package's
subpackage names are singular-noun subsystems (`optimizer/`, `auth/`,
`testing/`); a one-character copy of upstream's plural would diverge from the
package's own convention to match a name consumers never see benefit from.

The template ships **inside the package** at
`django_strawberry_framework/templates/django_strawberry_framework/debug_toolbar.html`
(the doubled directory is Django's app-template namespacing convention) and is
rendered via `render_to_string("django_strawberry_framework/debug_toolbar.html")`.
Resolution rides Django's `APP_DIRS` template loader against the package's
shipped [`AppConfig`][glossary-django-appconfig] — consumers already list
`"django_strawberry_framework"` in `INSTALLED_APPS` (the package's documented
install step since `0.0.7`), so the template resolves with zero new setup.
Packaging needs no new build configuration: [`pyproject.toml`][pyproject]'s
hatchling wheel target packages the `django_strawberry_framework` directory
wholesale, non-Python files included.

The tests are `tests/middleware/test_debug_toolbar.py` — a `tests/` package
mirroring the source subpackage, the same shape `tests/auth/` /
`tests/rest_framework/` use for their subpackages (the top-level
`tests/test_routers.py` shape applies to top-level modules, which this is not).

Alternatives considered (and rejected):

- **A top-level `middleware.py` module.** Rejected: [`docs/TREE.md`][tree]'s
  planned rows commit to the subpackage; the sibling card
  ([`TODO-ALPHA-044-0.0.14`][kanban]) similarly reserves `extensions/` — the
  two debug surfaces landing as sibling subpackages keeps the package tree
  legible; and a top-level module would need the router's lazier guard shape to
  stay walker-safe (see the rejected PEP 562 alternative in
  [Decision 5](#decision-5--soft-django-debug-toolbar-dependency-an-import-time-require_debug_toolbar-guard-the-rest_framework-shape)).
- **Serving the script from `static/` instead of a template.** Rejected: the
  asset is injected server-side into an already-rendered HTML body by
  `response.write(...)` — a template rendered to a string is the mechanism
  upstream uses and the only one that needs no URL configuration, no
  `collectstatic` step, and no extra request; a static file would add all
  three.
- **Inlining the script as a Python string constant.** Rejected: a ~45-line JS
  asset inside a Python module is unreviewable and unlintable as JS; the
  template file matches upstream (easing future diff-syncs against upstream
  fixes) and the app-dirs resolution costs nothing given the shipped
  `AppConfig`.

### Decision 5 — Soft `django-debug-toolbar` dependency: an import-time `require_debug_toolbar()` guard (the `rest_framework/` shape)

`django-debug-toolbar` joins `djangorestframework` and `channels` as the
package's third [soft dependency][glossary-soft-dependency], with the
established three-part architecture — but using the **import-time guard**
variant (the `rest_framework/` shape), not the router's [PEP 562
lazy-symbol][glossary-pep-562-lazy-export] variant:

1. **One guard, one hint — built on the shared optional-import owner.**
   `middleware/debug_toolbar.py` defines `require_debug_toolbar()` as a thin
   wrapper over
   [`require_optional_module`][glossary-require-optional-module]
   ([`utils/imports.py`][utils-imports], landed by [`spec-041`][spec-041]
   Slice 1 — no fourth hand-rolled import pattern), passing the single
   `_DEBUG_TOOLBAR_INSTALL_HINT` string naming the verified
   `django-debug-toolbar>=7.0.0` floor. No memoization: absence tests re-hit
   the guard after eviction, the [`require_drf()`][rf-init] /
   `require_channels()` contract.
2. **The guard runs at module import time, and the class is a plain module
   global.** The module body is: `require_debug_toolbar()`, then the
   `debug_toolbar.middleware` / `debug_toolbar.toolbar` (and
   `strawberry.django.views`) imports, then `_HTML_TYPES`, `_get_payload`, and
   the `DebugToolbarMiddleware` class. This is the card's own DoD wording ("the
   middleware module raises `ImportError` with an install hint when actually
   imported") and the `rest_framework/` precedent — [`spec-041`][spec-041]
   Decision 5 rejected import-time guarding *for the router* precisely because
   "a top-level module sitting in the package's own directory" gets imported by
   innocent whole-package walkers, and noted "the `rest_framework/` package
   could afford import-time because its import is itself the opt-in". The
   middleware leaf is the second case, not the first: nothing imports
   `django_strawberry_framework.middleware.debug_toolbar` except a consumer's
   `MIDDLEWARE` setting (via Django's `import_string` at startup) or an
   explicit import — both are the opt-in. The parent
   `middleware/__init__.py` imports nothing optional, so package walkers
   traverse cleanly; only the leaf pays.
3. **The dependency gate.** Slice 1 adds **`django-debug-toolbar>=7.0.0`** to
   `[dependency-groups].dev` and regenerates `uv.lock` in the same commit (the
   [`spec-039`][spec-039] lockfile discipline). **The floor is `7.0.0`,
   single-valued across the hint, the dev group, and the re-typed test
   literal** — and deliberately above upstream's `>=6.0.0`: per
   [PyPI metadata][debug-toolbar-pypi],
   `django-debug-toolbar` `6.0.0` (2025-07-25) classifies Django 4.2–5.2 only,
   while `7.0.0` is the **first checked release whose metadata covers the
   package's advertised Django 6.0 range** — it carries the
   `Framework :: Django :: 6.0` classifier, with `django>=5.2` and
   `python>=3.10` — exactly matching the package's own floors
   ([`pyproject.toml`][pyproject]: `Django>=5.2`, `requires-python >=3.10`,
   classifiers 5.2 + 6.0). The [`spec-041`][spec-041] single-floor rule applies
   verbatim: the install hint is the error message a deploying consumer
   follows, so it must not guide a Django 6.0 user into an unsupported toolbar.
   The worker records the pytest command for the maintainer rather than running
   the suite (the [`AGENTS.md`][agents] rule, [Slice checklist](#slice-checklist));
   the three-places-that-must-agree rule holds.

Alternatives considered (and rejected):

- **A hard dependency.** Rejected: the toolbar is a dev-only tool by its own
  design (it disables itself outside `DEBUG` + `INTERNAL_IPS`); taxing every
  production install with it inverts its purpose. Upstream itself ships it as
  an extra, not a core dependency.
- **A `django-strawberry-framework[debug-toolbar]` extra (upstream's shape).**
  Rejected: the DRF and channels precedents both rejected extras — an extra
  changes how consumers *install*, not whether the import needs guarding (an
  extra is advisory; nothing stops an extra-less install from listing the
  middleware), so it adds a second documented thing without removing any code.
  Three soft dependencies with one uniform no-extras contract beats two
  contracts.
- **The PEP 562 lazy-symbol shape (the `routers.py` pattern: clean module
  import, guard fires on attribute access).** Rejected for this surface, with
  the reasoning made explicit since the two shapes now coexist in the package:
  (a) the consumer's access path is Django's `import_string` on a settings
  string, which imports the module and immediately does `getattr` — the guard
  fires at the same startup moment either way, so laziness buys the consumer
  nothing; (b) the leaf module has no reason to be importable without its
  dependency — unlike `routers.py` (a top-level module walkers must traverse),
  nothing legitimate imports the leaf except the opt-in; (c) the lazy shape
  costs a builder function, a module-global cache, a `__getattr__`, and a
  `# noqa: F822` — real complexity the router needed and this module does not;
  and (d) the card's DoD pre-pins the import-time wording. The
  decision rule this leaves behind: **a top-level module lazies; a dedicated
  opt-in leaf guards at import.**
- **Guarding inside `DebugToolbarMiddleware.__init__` (a stub class).**
  Rejected: the class *body* needs the import (it subclasses the stock
  middleware), so a stub would lie about identity — the exact rejection
  [`spec-041`][spec-041] recorded for the router stub, and here the two-phase
  failure would be worse: Django imports middleware at startup, so the error
  would move from a clean startup `ImportError` to a first-request failure.

### Decision 6 — Subclass-and-override, borrowed as-is: `process_view` + `_postprocess`, `_get_payload`, `_HTML_TYPES`

The middleware **subclasses** `debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware`
and overrides exactly two methods; the module carries the `_get_payload` helper
and `_HTML_TYPES` constant at module level. Every behavior is upstream's,
verbatim (the card's architectural posture: "Not a from-scratch middleware...
we do not re-implement the panel-rendering logic that `django-debug-toolbar`
already owns"):

- **`process_view(request, view_func, *args, **kwargs)`** — resolve
  `view = getattr(view_func, "view_class", None)` (the attribute Django's
  `View.as_view()` sets on the returned callable) and tag
  `request._is_graphiql = isinstance(view, type) and issubclass(view,
  BaseView)`. The override does not chain to `super()` — and does not need to:
  the stock `debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware` defines no
  `process_view` of its own (it is a `__call__` / `__acall__`-style middleware
  across the toolbar's whole `3.8`–`6.x` line), so there is no stock hook to
  preserve. This method's one deliberate divergence from upstream (the first of
  the module's two — the other is `_get_payload`'s non-mapping bail) is the
  `isinstance(view, type)` guard in front of `issubclass`: upstream writes
  `bool(view and issubclass(...))`, which raises `TypeError` if a `view_class`
  attribute is ever a non-class, and this middleware runs `process_view` for
  **all** global traffic (see
  [Decision 7](#decision-7--strawberry-view-detection-issubclass-against-strawberrydjangoviewsbaseview-engine-owned--resolving-the-cards-djangographqlview-hedge)).
  Otherwise mirroring upstream. (Verified against the upstream source: its
  `process_view` body is the two lines above modulo that guard, no `super()`
  call — and against the toolbar sources: no stock `process_view` to chain to.)
- **`_postprocess(request, response, toolbar)`** — chain to
  `super()._postprocess(...)` **first**. What the stock method does at 7.0.0,
  in order: generates stats and server timing for **every** enabled panel;
  **renders and stores the toolbar for every processed response** — JSON
  included ("Always render the toolbar for the history panel"); adds panel
  headers; and only then, conditionally, inserts the handle into processable
  HTML. The unconditional render/store is the mechanism this whole card rides:
  it is why a JSON operation gets a history row and stored panel content that
  `render_panel` can later serve (Test 6), why a missing URLconf's
  `NoReverseMatch` fires on JSON requests too — the render reverses `djdt:`
  routes ([User-facing API](#user-facing-api)) — and why every tagged JSON
  operation pays a full server-side toolbar render in dev (expected
  upstream-parity behavior, stated so it isn't a surprise). The package must
  not re-implement or skip any of it. Then:
  - **streaming responses return immediately** (no body to inspect or mutate);
  - **HTML path** — `Content-Type`'s first segment in `_HTML_TYPES`, request
    tagged `_is_graphiql`, status 200: append
    `render_to_string("django_strawberry_framework/debug_toolbar.html")` via
    `response.write(...)` and refresh `Content-Length` when the header is
    present. This is what arms the GraphiQL page: the stock `_postprocess`
    injected the toolbar UI; the appended script teaches it to update from
    fetch responses.
  - **JSON path** — request tagged `_is_graphiql` and `Content-Type` is
    `application/json`: read `operationName` from `json.loads(request.body)`
    (**any** exception → `None` — malformed bodies, multipart bodies, GET
    queries with no body all degrade to "inject"); skip entirely when it is
    `"IntrospectionQuery"`
    ([Decision 8](#decision-8--the-introspection-query-skip-is-preserved-verbatim));
    otherwise `_get_payload(request, response, toolbar)` and — when it returns
    a payload — re-encode `response.content = json.dumps(payload,
    cls=DjangoJSONEncoder)` and refresh `Content-Length`.
- **`_get_payload`** — `None` when the toolbar assigned no `request_id`
  (nothing to reference); `None` again when the decoded body is not a mapping
  (the P2.3 divergence: a non-object JSON body would otherwise make the
  `debugToolbar` subscript-assign raise and 500 the request); otherwise decode
  the response body with the
  response's own charset, attach `debugToolbar = {"panels": ..., "requestId":
  toolbar.request_id}` from `reversed(toolbar.enabled_panels)` — per panel,
  `title` only when `panel.has_content` (else `None`, which the frontend
  treats as "don't touch this panel's content area") and `nav_subtitle`, both
  called when callable — and **skip `TemplatesPanel`** (upstream's comment-free
  but deliberate exclusion: the panel's nav content churns per request and the
  lazy re-fetch handles it poorly).
- **`DjangoJSONEncoder`** for the re-encode — the payload embeds panel
  subtitle values that can be lazy translation proxies / datetimes; Django's
  encoder is the one that serializes them.

Alternatives considered (and rejected):

- **A from-scratch Django middleware reading `connection.queries`.** Rejected
  by the card's own posture line — that mechanism (lower-fidelity,
  response-side) is the *sibling card's* design space, and re-implementing
  panel rendering would break every toolbar panel except SQL while doubling
  the maintenance surface.
- **Chaining `super().process_view(...)`.** Rejected: the stock
  `debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware` defines **no**
  `process_view` — it is a `__call__` / `__acall__`-style middleware in every
  release across the toolbar's `3.8`–`6.x` line (verified against the on-disk
  toolbar sources), so there is no stock `process_view` behavior to preserve
  and nothing for `super().process_view(...)` to reach but the base-class
  no-op. Upstream's override therefore does not chain, and neither does this
  one; byte-borrowing that choice keeps the module diffable against its
  reference.
- **Injecting into every JSON response (dropping the `_is_graphiql` gate).**
  Rejected: the gate scopes injection to responses from a **Strawberry Django
  view**, so a JSON response from some *other* view (a DRF endpoint, an admin
  AJAX call) never grows a `debugToolbar` key. It does **not** narrow injection
  to the IDE — every JSON response from the GraphQL view gets the key while the
  toolbar is enabled, IDE-originated or not (the honest contract stated in the
  [User-facing API](#user-facing-api)); the gate's job is view-scoping, not
  IDE-detection. Dropping it entirely would leak the key onto unrelated JSON
  views, which is why it stays even though it is not an IDE filter.

### Decision 7 — Strawberry-view detection: `issubclass` against `strawberry.django.views.BaseView` (engine-owned) — resolving the card's `DjangoGraphQLView` hedge

The card hedges the detection target: "Our equivalent uses the same
`issubclass` check against whichever view class the package settles on (working
name `DjangoGraphQLView`; pinned during implementation)." This spec resolves
the hedge with a fact: **the package ships no view class, and should not grow
one for this card.** The package's documented consumer wiring — and fakeshop's
real URLconf ([`examples/fakeshop/config/urls.py`][config-urls]) — uses
Strawberry's own `strawberry.django.views.GraphQLView` (or `AsyncGraphQLView`);
both subclass the engine-owned `strawberry.django.views.BaseView` (verified at
the installed strawberry 0.316.0, [`strawberry/django/views.py`][venv-strawberry-views] —
`BaseView` holds the shared constructor; the two concrete views mix it with the
sync/async HTTP-view bases). So the detection target is **`BaseView`, exactly
as upstream's is** — the check is engine-shaped, not package-shaped, and it
covers every consumer who wires Strawberry's Django views, subclassed or not.
This is the "Strawberry stays as the engine" line ([`README.md`][readme])
applied to view identity, the same way [`spec-041`][spec-041] Decision 7
applied it to the Channels consumers.

Three mechanical notes the implementation carries:

- `strawberry.django.views` is **Strawberry core's** Django integration (inside
  the pinned `strawberry-graphql>=0.262.0` floor — presence re-confirmed at the
  Slice-1 gate), not `strawberry-graphql-django`; the import adds no
  dependency. It is imported at module level *after* the guard — it needs
  Django configured but nothing optional.
- The `view_class` attribute survives decoration: `View.as_view()` sets it on
  the returned function, and Django's stacked decorators
  (`ensure_csrf_cookie`, which fakeshop's URLconf actually applies) copy
  function `__dict__` via `functools.wraps` — so the fakeshop view is detected
  through its decorator, and the test plan pins exactly that path (the tests
  drive fakeshop's real decorated URL).
- **The `issubclass` call is guarded with `isinstance(view, type)`** — the one
  deliberate divergence from upstream's verbatim `bool(view and
  issubclass(view, BaseView))`, added because this middleware is installed
  globally and `process_view` runs for **every** request, GraphQL or not.
  `view = getattr(view_func, "view_class", None)` is normally `None` (function
  views) or a class (`View.as_view()`), but nothing forbids an unrelated
  decorator or helper from attaching a **non-class** `view_class`; a bare
  `issubclass(non_class, BaseView)` raises `TypeError`, which — on the global
  middleware path — would 500 an unrelated view. `isinstance(view, type)`
  short-circuits to `False` first (reproduced: `issubclass("x", BaseView)`
  raises `TypeError: issubclass() arg 1 must be a class`). This is a strict
  robustness improvement, not a detection change: `None` and every real view
  class resolve identically to upstream, so no legitimate Strawberry view's
  detection differs. It joins the card's other documented divergences (the
  `middleware/` rename, the `>=7.0.0` floor, the dropped `@override`, the
  template hook's robustness fix) rather than silently breaking the "borrow
  verbatim" posture, and Test 14a pins the non-class case the real-request tests
  cannot reach.

Alternatives considered (and rejected):

- **Ship a package `DjangoGraphQLView` and detect that.** Rejected: a view
  class introduced *so that a middleware can `issubclass` it* is surface for
  surface's sake — it would narrow detection to consumers who adopt the new
  view (breaking every existing `GraphQLView` consumer, including fakeshop)
  and create a public API this card has no other reason to ship. If a future
  card ships a package view for its own reasons, it subclasses `BaseView` and
  detection keeps working unchanged.
- **Path-based detection (`request.path == settings.GRAPHQL_PATH`).**
  Rejected: it invents the settings key
  [Decision 2](#decision-2--card-scope-boundary-the-server-side-toolbar-integration-ships-the-in-response-surface-fakeshop-settings-opt-in-and-async-verification-stay-out)
  forbids, breaks multi-endpoint schemas, and diverges from upstream's proven
  mechanism for zero gain.
- **Duck-typed detection (`hasattr(view, "schema")`).** Rejected: looser than
  `issubclass` with no compensating benefit — any consumer view exposing a
  `schema` attribute would be silently tagged, and the upstream-parity claim
  ("the same `issubclass` check") would be false.

### Decision 8 — The introspection-query skip is preserved, verbatim

When a Strawberry-view JSON request's `operationName` is
`"IntrospectionQuery"`, no payload is computed and the response passes through
untouched. The reason is upstream's, kept in the module as a comment: IDEs
(Apollo Sandbox, GraphiQL's own schema poller) issue introspection constantly
in the background; injecting per-introspection payloads floods the toolbar's
request history and evicts the developer's actual operations from it. The
detection reads the request body's `operationName` field — the standard GraphQL
POST envelope — with the broad-exception fallback to `None` (a body that
cannot be parsed is by definition not the IDE's introspection poll).

The skip is deliberately **name-based, not content-based**: a consumer who
issues an introspection query under a different `operationName` gets a payload
(harmless), and a consumer who names a data query `IntrospectionQuery` loses
its payload (their choice). Matching upstream exactly here matters more than
closing that cosmetic gap — the skip's contract must be identical for the
one-settings-string migration
([Goal 3](#goals)) to be behavior-preserving.

Alternatives considered (and rejected):

- **Parsing the query text for `__schema` selections.** Rejected: a GraphQL
  parse per response on the dev hot path, to improve a heuristic whose false
  positives are cosmetic. Upstream's name check is O(1) and proven.
- **Making the skip configurable.** Rejected: a knob on a dev tool's history
  hygiene is configuration surface nobody asked for; upstream ships none.

### Decision 9 — Test strategy: package tests driving real in-process fakeshop requests under settings overrides; eviction-simulated absence

All tests live in `tests/middleware/test_debug_toolbar.py`. The
[live-first mandate][glossary-live-first-coverage-mandate] sends a test to
`examples/fakeshop/test_query/` when "a package line can be covered by a real
fakeshop GraphQL request" **through the example's shipped configuration** — and
no `middleware/debug_toolbar.py` line can be: fakeshop's shipped settings
deliberately carry no `debug_toolbar` app, no toolbar middleware, and no
show-toolbar override
([Decision 2](#decision-2--card-scope-boundary-the-server-side-toolbar-integration-ships-the-in-response-surface-fakeshop-settings-opt-in-and-async-verification-stay-out)),
so the middleware exists in the request path only when a test's own settings
override puts it there. Per-test settings mutation is package-test machinery,
not the example's consumer-visible surface — the same
genuinely-unreachable-live reasoning [`spec-041`][spec-041] Decision 8 recorded
for the WSGI-only router, applied to a shipped-settings boundary instead of a
protocol boundary.

The tests are **not** structural for it — they drive the real thing. Because
[`pytest.ini`][pytest-ini] points the whole suite at fakeshop's
`config.settings`, a `tests/middleware/` test uses `django.test.Client` against
fakeshop's real `/graphql/` URL — the real GraphiQL HTML render (through the
real `ensure_csrf_cookie` decorator, proving the `view_class` detection
survives decoration), and a real products query emitting real SQL through the
real optimizer — with a test fixture layering the toolbar's **three** pieces on
top via `django.test.utils.override_settings` / `modify_settings`. The DEBUG
posture is the load-bearing detail: the checked-in fakeshop
[`config/settings.py`][config-settings] sets `DEBUG = True`, but
[`pytest.ini`][pytest-ini] does not set `django_debug_mode`, so pytest-django
defaults it to `False` and forces `settings.DEBUG = False` for the whole suite
at `setup_test_environment(debug=False)` time — pytest-django's documented
`django_debug_mode` ini-option behavior (its default is `False`), a property
of the tool, not of any locally installed copy (the local-source spot-check
belongs in the build notes, not here). So the fixture
must **re-enable `DEBUG=True` itself** — both because the toolbar's default
gate returns `False` when `DEBUG` is false (verified in
[`debug_toolbar.middleware.show_toolbar`][debug-toolbar-middleware-source] at
7.0.0: `if not settings.DEBUG: return False` is the first check) *and* because
[`debug_toolbar_urls()`][debug-toolbar-toolbar-source] returns
`[]` when `DEBUG` is false, so the panel routes would not exist. The fixture:

- `override_settings(DEBUG=True)` — re-enables the toolbar's `DEBUG` gate and
  arms the `DEBUG`-gated `debug_toolbar_urls()`; makes the test independent of
  pytest-django's suite default and of any future change to fakeshop's own
  `DEBUG`.
- `modify_settings(INSTALLED_APPS={"append": "debug_toolbar"})` — Django's
  test utilities fire `setting_changed`, whose `INSTALLED_APPS` receiver
  rebuilds the app registry and the `get_app_template_dirs` cache
  (`django/test/signals.py::update_installed_apps`), so the toolbar's panels
  and templates materialize per-test.
- `override_settings(MIDDLEWARE=[...])` — a list **built from the real
  `settings.MIDDLEWARE`** with the package's dotted path inserted near the
  front, preserving the rest of fakeshop's stack (sessions, CSRF, auth,
  messages) so the test path stays the real fakeshop request path — never an
  abbreviated replacement list. The insert replaces nothing (fakeshop ships no
  stock toolbar entry), and the list must never contain **both** the stock
  `debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware` and the package middleware.
- `override_settings(ROOT_URLCONF="tests.middleware.debug_toolbar_urls")` — a
  tiny test URLconf module ([Implementation plan](#implementation-plan)) whose
  module body composes fakeshop's real `urlpatterns` **plus**
  `debug_toolbar_urls()`, so the `djdt` namespace and its panel-content routes
  (`render_panel`) actually resolve. Without this, **every** toolbar-processed
  request dies with `NoReverseMatch` — the stock postprocess unconditionally
  renders the toolbar, whose template reverses `djdt:` routes
  ([User-facing API](#user-facing-api)) — so the whole present-path group
  crashes on its first request; Test 6 additionally needs the routes to serve
  the stored panel content. **Import ordering is load-bearing and part of the
  fixture contract:** `debug_toolbar_urls()` returns `[]` when `settings.DEBUG`
  is false and the module-level `urlpatterns` are computed **once, at first
  import** — so if anything imports the test URLconf while pytest-django's
  forced `DEBUG=False` is still in effect, the `djdt` namespace is permanently
  missing for that module object and the present-path tests crash with
  `NoReverseMatch` even though the fixture later sets `DEBUG=True`. Therefore: the test file never imports the URLconf module
  at module level (it is referenced **only** by dotted path in the
  `ROOT_URLCONF` override); the fixture activates the override only after
  `override_settings(DEBUG=True)` is in effect; on setup the fixture **evicts
  `"tests.middleware.debug_toolbar_urls"` from `sys.modules`** before the first
  request so its `urlpatterns` are computed under `DEBUG=True`; and on teardown
  it evicts the module again, so no later test can inherit `urlpatterns`
  computed under the wrong `DEBUG` value.
- `override_settings(DEBUG_TOOLBAR_CONFIG={"SHOW_TOOLBAR_CALLBACK": <always-true>})`
  — pins the show-toolbar decision to true regardless of `REMOTE_ADDR` /
  `INTERNAL_IPS` (the default gate's second check), so the test is independent
  of client-address defaults. Overriding the callback is
  `django-debug-toolbar`'s own documented test recipe.

**Cache hygiene is part of the fixture contract, not an afterthought.**
`django-debug-toolbar` 7.0.0 memoizes the resolved show-toolbar callback with
`functools.cache`
([`debug_toolbar.middleware.show_toolbar_func_or_path`][debug-toolbar-middleware-source],
verified `@cache`-decorated), and caches its panel classes and URL patterns on
the toolbar class ([`DebugToolbar._panel_classes` /
`DebugToolbar._urlpatterns`][debug-toolbar-toolbar-source]).
A per-test `DEBUG_TOOLBAR_CONFIG` / app / URLconf override that does not clear
these can leak a stale always-true callback (or stale panel/url set) into a
later test on the same worker — especially under `--dist loadscope`, which keeps
a module's tests on one worker, so the local file passes while a neighbor
inherits the leaked callback. The fixture therefore treats these as
**save / clear / restore** state, not set-to-`None` state: on setup it calls
`debug_toolbar.middleware.show_toolbar_func_or_path.cache_clear()`, **saves**
the current `DebugToolbar._panel_classes` / `DebugToolbar._urlpatterns` values,
then sets both to `None`; on teardown it calls `cache_clear()` again, discards
whatever values the test populated, and **restores the saved values** — so a
neighboring test (or an earlier same-worker test that had already initialized
the toolbar's caches) gets back exactly the state it had, rather than a
fixture-imposed `None`. Because all present-path tests share one fixed toolbar
configuration, the panel/url handling is belt-and-suspenders; the callback
`cache_clear()` is mandatory because it is tied directly to the per-test
`DEBUG_TOOLBAR_CONFIG` override.

One more fixture obligation, from pytest-django rather than the toolbar: the
toolbar-present tests drive fakeshop's real `/graphql/` view and (in Tests 3
and 6) `seed_data(1)` — real ORM traffic — so **the toolbar-present group
carries `pytest.mark.django_db`** (a module- or class-level mark over the
group is preferred, since every test in it can open the database through the
fakeshop schema or the SQL panel). Without the mark, pytest-django's database
blocker trips on the first SQL-emitting request before the middleware behavior
is exercised. The absence / guard tests (Tests 9–12) are pure import-machinery
tests and stay **unmarked**.

A second suite-shape obligation comes from *where* these tests run: they
execute real GraphQL through the aggregate `config.schema` from inside the
package tree — the tree whose files call `registry.clear()` for isolation.
[`test_query/README.md`][test-query-readme] documents the failure class: after
a package test clears the global type registry, the combined schema is exposed
to a `LazyType` `KeyError` under collection orders that did not happen to
pre-materialize the referenced types — an order-dependent flake that
`--dist loadscope` localizes to whichever worker drew both files. Every
fakeshop acceptance suite answers it with the
[schema reload discipline][glossary-schema-reload-discipline]'s single-sited
`schema_reload.reload_all_project_schemas()` helper (importable from any test
via [`pytest.ini`][pytest-ini]'s `pythonpath = examples/fakeshop`), which
rebuilds every contributing app's schema in dependency-safe order, then
reloads `config.schema` / `config.urls` and clears URL caches. The
toolbar-present fixture calls the same helper **first, on setup, before the
URLconf steps** — so the test URLconf composes freshly rebuilt fakeshop
`urlpatterns` and every request executes a fully re-registered schema
regardless of what ran earlier on the worker. The absence / guard tests
(9–12), the targeted units (13–15), and the template-port guard (16) never
execute GraphQL and skip the reload.

The toolbar-absent path reuses the
[eviction-simulated absence][glossary-eviction-simulated-absence] discipline —
strict `sys.modules` eviction of `debug_toolbar*` and
`django_strawberry_framework.middleware.debug_toolbar`, with the **two-sided
restore** (the parent `middleware` package's `debug_toolbar` attribute is
saved/restored alongside the `sys.modules` entries, putting the original module
object back in both places — the [`spec-041`][spec-041] Revision-2 refinement
that closes the `pytest-xdist` order-dependence hole) — but simulates the
absence itself with an **importlib-compatible `sys.modules["debug_toolbar"] =
None` sentinel, not the `builtins.__import__` block the router/DRF fixtures
use** (Revision 5). The distinction is load-bearing here in a way it is not for
the router: `require_debug_toolbar()` is a thin
[`require_optional_module`][glossary-require-optional-module] wrapper, i.e. an
`importlib.import_module("debug_toolbar")` call, and `importlib` routes through
`importlib._bootstrap._gcd_import` — it does **not** consult
`builtins.__import__`. A `__import__` block is therefore a no-op for this guard:
it re-imports the still-installed toolbar and the guard returns it, so the raise
(if any) would come from a later hintless statement-import rather than the
wrapped guard — Tests 10/12 would fail for the wrong reason. A `None` entry in
`sys.modules` is the documented importlib absence sentinel: `import_module`
raises `ModuleNotFoundError` (`"import of debug_toolbar halted; None in
sys.modules"`), which the guard catches and re-raises as the install hint.
(Empirically verified against the installed `channels`: under a `__import__`
block `importlib.import_module` still returns the real module; under the `None`
sentinel it raises. The same sentinel shape is documented in
[`utils/imports.py`][utils-imports]'s `import_attr_if_importable`.) The block is
still fine for the DRF/router fixtures — DRF's guard is a direct `import`
statement, and the router's builder statement-imports `channels.*` submodules
that the block *does* see — but this guard's importlib shape needs the sentinel.
The install hint is matched against a **re-typed literal** in the test file (the
`_HINT_SUBSTRING` drift-catch discipline — a test asserting the imported
constant against itself could never notice the hint drifting from the dev-group
floor).

Alternatives considered (and rejected):

- **A live `examples/fakeshop/test_query/` placement with the same settings
  overrides.** Rejected: the live suite's charter is "consumer-visible GraphQL
  behavior" through the example as shipped, and its coverage rule reserves the
  fall-back for code "genuinely unreachable from a live `/graphql/` request"
  ([`test_query/README.md`][test-query-readme]) — which these lines are until
  settings opt in. A test that must rewrite `INSTALLED_APPS` / `MIDDLEWARE`
  before the surface exists is asserting package-internal wiring, not the
  example's shipped behavior; it would blur the boundary the
  [live-first mandate][glossary-live-first-coverage-mandate]'s placement rule
  protects. When a future card opts fakeshop's settings into the toolbar for
  real, the covering test moves live and the package stand-in is deleted (the
  documented promotion rule).
- **Wiring `debug_toolbar` permanently into fakeshop settings for the tests'
  benefit.** Rejected in
  [Decision 2](#decision-2--card-scope-boundary-the-server-side-toolbar-integration-ships-the-in-response-surface-fakeshop-settings-opt-in-and-async-verification-stay-out);
  additionally it would put the toolbar's middleware into every *other* suite
  request's path (inert but present), a blanket change to the whole suite's
  request pipeline for one test file's convenience.
- **Unit-testing the overrides against synthetic
  `HttpRequest` / `HttpResponse` objects only.** Rejected: the module exists
  to compose with the *real* toolbar lifecycle (`super()._postprocess`
  behavior, `toolbar.request_id` assignment, panel enablement) and the *real*
  Strawberry view (`view_class` through a decorator) — precisely the seams
  synthetic objects would fake. The [`START.md`][start] "coverage is a
  feature" posture: if the composition is wrong, only real traffic notices.
- **Uninstall-based absence testing (a separate no-toolbar CI job).**
  Rejected: the DRF and channels precedents both chose simulation (one env,
  one `uv run pytest` gate, no matrix).

### Decision 10 — Version bumps are owned by the joint `0.0.14` cut

No slice in this card edits the package-version state: `[project].version` in
[`pyproject.toml`][pyproject], `__version__` in [`__init__.py`][init], or
[`tests/base/test_init.py::test_version`][test-base-init]. This card **shares
the `0.0.14` patch line** with two open siblings —
[`TODO-ALPHA-043-0.0.14`][kanban] and [`TODO-ALPHA-044-0.0.14`][kanban] — and
one landed predecessor, [`DONE-041-0.0.14`][kanban], whose spec's Decision 10
already deferred the bump to the **[joint `0.0.14`
cut][glossary-joint-version-cut]** (the last `0.0.14` card to land). The
board's `## Done` column confirms `DONE-041` flipped Done with the version line
still reading `0.0.13` — the deferral this card continues. The release-status
wording splits the same way: Slice 2 updates **implemented-on-main** docs (the
GLOSSARY entry body, the regenerated [`docs/TREE.md`][tree]) but the public
`shipped (0.0.14)` status flip, the [`README.md`][readme] /
[`docs/README.md`][docs-readme] "Coming next" → "Shipped today" moves, and the
`CHANGELOG.md` bullets defer to the joint cut.

**`uv.lock` is NOT a version file — it is updated in this card, deliberately.**
The Slice-1 dependency gate adds `django-debug-toolbar` to
`[dependency-groups].dev` and regenerates the lockfile in the same commit; the
**toolbar dependency entries** in `uv.lock` change here, while the package's
own `version` entry inside it stays `0.0.13` until the joint cut — the exact
reconciliation [`spec-041`][spec-041] Decision 10 pinned for the channels
dev-group add.

Justification: per [`docs/SPECS/NEXT.md`][next] Step 3 / Step 6, when multiple
cards target one patch version the bump belongs to the joint cut, not any
individual card's spec. Three non-Done cards remain at `0.0.14` after this one
flips; this card is not the last.

Alternatives considered (and rejected):

- **Bump to `0.0.14` in Slice 2.** Rejected: two siblings still ship into
  `0.0.14`; a per-card bump races the joint cut and would be reconciled twice
  over.
- **Defer the lockfile regeneration to the joint cut too.** Rejected: Slice 1's
  tests import `debug_toolbar`; a dev-dependency without its lock entry breaks
  the reproducible-env contract the moment CI runs `uv sync`.

## Implementation plan

The file-level delta map for the Worker 0 build handoff (each row's contract is
specified in the decisions cited; **no slice bumps the version** — the joint
`0.0.14` cut owns it,
[Decision 10](#decision-10--version-bumps-are-owned-by-the-joint-0014-cut)):

## Helper-reuse obligations (DRY)

The module is small; the ledger is short. Reuse is named per item, and
deliberate *non*-reuse carries its reason (the [`spec-040`][spec-040] /
[`spec-041`][spec-041] discipline).

- [ ] **D1** — the guard rides
  [`utils/imports.py::require_optional_module`][glossary-require-optional-module]
  (landed by [`spec-041`][spec-041] Slice 1): `require_debug_toolbar()` is a
  thin wrapper passing `_DEBUG_TOOLBAR_INSTALL_HINT` — never a fourth
  hand-rolled import pattern
  ([Decision 5](#decision-5--soft-django-debug-toolbar-dependency-an-import-time-require_debug_toolbar-guard-the-rest_framework-shape)).
- [ ] **D2** — the install-hint string lives in exactly one module constant
  (`_DEBUG_TOOLBAR_INSTALL_HINT`), matched in tests by a **re-typed literal**
  (the `_HINT_SUBSTRING` drift-catch discipline from
  [`test_soft_dependency.py`][test-soft-dependency], now three-for-three across
  the soft dependencies).
- [ ] **D3** — the toolbar-absent fixture reuses the eviction + **two-sided
  restore** pattern (the [`spec-041`][spec-041] refinement: the parent
  `middleware` package's attribute is saved/restored together with the
  `sys.modules` entries, so no test order leaves the attribute path and the
  import path holding different module objects), but simulates the absence with
  an importlib-compatible `sys.modules["debug_toolbar"] = None` sentinel rather
  than the `builtins.__import__` block the DRF/router fixtures use — because the
  guard imports via `importlib`, which the block does not intercept
  ([Decision 9](#decision-9--test-strategy-package-tests-driving-real-in-process-fakeshop-requests-under-settings-overrides-eviction-simulated-absence),
  Revision 5). The eviction + restore structure is copied and target names
  swapped; the absence *mechanism* is deliberately not. **This is the third copy
  of the absence fixture** (DRF, router, now toolbar) — but the three are **not**
  behavior-identical, and that is the point: DRF blocks a direct `import`
  statement, the router blocks `channels.*` submodule statement-imports its
  builder runs, and this guard needs the `None` sentinel because
  `importlib.import_module` bypasses the block. So **do not factor a shared
  absence helper in this card.** A premature extraction with a single "pluggable
  import-blocker predicate" would encode the wrong assumption that all guards
  share one absence mechanism; the correct extraction (deferred to a dedicated
  cleanup card) must support **both** the block shape (direct/statement-import
  guards) **and** the sentinel shape (importlib guards). Do not block this card
  on it, and do not let the toolbar copy drift from the two-sided-restore
  discipline.
- [ ] **D4** — the guard has **no memoization**, and the module holds **no
  class cache to manage**: unlike the router's `_ROUTER_CLASS`, the class is a
  plain module global, so `sys.modules` eviction alone fully resets the
  module's state — one less moving part in the absence fixture
  ([Decision 5](#decision-5--soft-django-debug-toolbar-dependency-an-import-time-require_debug_toolbar-guard-the-rest_framework-shape)).
- [ ] **D-N1** (non-reuse) — no re-implementation of anything
  `django-debug-toolbar` owns: no panel logic, no request-id assignment, no
  handle rendering, no history storage. The subclass calls
  `super()._postprocess(...)` before its own work and overrides nothing else
  ([Decision 6](#decision-6--subclass-and-override-borrowed-as-is-process_view--_postprocess-_get_payload-_html_types)).
- [ ] **D-N2** (non-reuse) — the middleware does **not** route through
  [`request_from_info`][glossary-request-from-info]: it is a Django HTTP
  middleware operating on the raw `HttpRequest` / `HttpResponse` pair before
  and after the view, not a resolver-context surface — the helper's
  single-siting rule governs resolver-reachable request decoding, which this
  module never does.
- [ ] **D-N3** (non-reuse) — the JSON body inspection (`json.loads(request.body)`
  for `operationName`) is deliberately local and upstream-shaped, not routed
  through any package parsing helper: it is a best-effort sniff with a
  swallow-everything fallback, semantics no shared helper should advertise.

## Edge cases and constraints

- **`import django_strawberry_framework.middleware.debug_toolbar` on a
  toolbar-less machine.** Raises `ImportError` carrying the install hint, with
  the original chained — this IS the designed behavior (the module import is
  the opt-in,
  [Decision 5](#decision-5--soft-django-debug-toolbar-dependency-an-import-time-require_debug_toolbar-guard-the-rest_framework-shape)).
  The behavior matrix the tests pin: root package import → clean;
  `django_strawberry_framework.middleware` package import → clean; the leaf
  module import → `ImportError` with hint; `from django_strawberry_framework
  import *` → toolbar-free (no root export exists).
- **The consumer must list the package in `INSTALLED_APPS`.** The template
  resolves through the app-dirs loader against the package's
  [`AppConfig`][glossary-django-appconfig] — already the package's documented
  install step (and required for the [Trac #37064
  hardening][glossary-django-trac-37064-hardening] to apply). A consumer who
  skipped it gets `TemplateDoesNotExist` on the first GraphiQL page render
  with the toolbar enabled; the GLOSSARY body names the fix. A consumer with
  `APP_DIRS=False` and a bespoke loader configuration owns adding the
  equivalent (standard Django app-template mechanics, not package-specific).
- **The toolbar requires `django.contrib.staticfiles` + `STATIC_URL` — and
  with this middleware the failure surfaces on `/graphql/`.** The toolbar's
  own documented install prerequisite: `render_toolbar` converts a
  `TemplateSyntaxError` into `ImproperlyConfigured` explicitly naming
  `django.contrib.staticfiles` and `STATIC_URL`. Because the stock postprocess
  renders the toolbar for every processed response
  ([Decision 6](#decision-6--subclass-and-override-borrowed-as-is-process_view--_postprocess-_get_payload-_html_types)),
  a consumer without staticfiles hits that error on their **GraphQL**
  endpoint and will plausibly file it against this package — the GLOSSARY
  body names the fix alongside the `TemplateDoesNotExist` note. Fakeshop
  ships staticfiles + `STATIC_URL`, so the test plan is unaffected.
- **The package middleware REPLACES the stock toolbar entry.** It subclasses
  the stock middleware, so listing both would run the toolbar pipeline twice
  (double handles, double history rows). Same contract as upstream; documented
  in the GLOSSARY body and the User-facing API block. Ordering guidance is the
  toolbar's own ("as early as possible, after encoding-touching middleware");
  the package adds no ordering constraint of its own.
- **Show-toolbar gating is inherited, untouched.** The default
  `debug_toolbar.middleware.show_toolbar` returns `False` when `settings.DEBUG`
  is false (the first, decisive check at 7.0.0) and otherwise only when
  `REMOTE_ADDR` is in `INTERNAL_IPS` — so the toolbar (and every injected byte)
  is off in production, and the subclass flows through as a near-no-op
  (`process_view` tags one attribute; `_postprocess` is only reached when the
  stock middleware decided to process at all). Note this is why the test fixture
  must set **both** `DEBUG=True` (pytest-django forces the suite to `DEBUG=False`)
  **and** an always-true `SHOW_TOOLBAR_CALLBACK` (to be independent of
  `INTERNAL_IPS` / `REMOTE_ADDR`) — it satisfies the real gate rather than
  bypassing it
  ([Decision 9](#decision-9--test-strategy-package-tests-driving-real-in-process-fakeshop-requests-under-settings-overrides-eviction-simulated-absence)).
- **Streaming responses are skipped.** `response.streaming` returns before any
  body inspection — a streaming body has no `.content` to decode or append to.
  Strawberry's Django views stream only for multipart-subscription responses;
  either way the guard is upstream's and stays.
- **`request.body` re-read in `_postprocess`.** Django caches the raw body
  bytes after first access (the view already read it), so the `operationName`
  sniff costs no I/O and raises no "body already read" — with one exception:
  a **multipart** upload request ([`Upload` scalar][glossary-upload-scalar]
  mutations) may have had its body consumed by the multipart parser;
  `json.loads` on it then raises inside the broad `except`, `operation_name`
  degrades to `None`, and the payload is injected normally. Degradation, not
  breakage — and identical to upstream.
- **A GraphiQL GET with `?query=` (queries via GET).** The response is JSON,
  the request is Strawberry-view-tagged, and `json.loads(request.body)` on the empty
  GET body raises → `operationName` is `None` → payload injected. Consistent
  with upstream; noted so the GET path in the tests is understood as covered
  by design rather than accident.
- **`_is_graphiql` is set on every request the middleware sees** (the
  attribute is written unconditionally in `process_view`), so `_postprocess`
  never needs a `hasattr` dance; requests that bypass `process_view`
  (short-circuited by an earlier middleware) fall back to
  `getattr(request, "_is_graphiql", False)` — upstream's exact read, kept.
- **Non-Strawberry GraphQL views are not tagged.** A consumer serving GraphQL
  through something that is not a `strawberry.django.views.BaseView` subclass
  gets stock toolbar behavior only (no injection). Documented as the
  detection contract
  ([Decision 7](#decision-7--strawberry-view-detection-issubclass-against-strawberrydjangoviewsbaseview-engine-owned--resolving-the-cards-djangographqlview-hedge));
  the escape hatch is subclassing the package middleware and widening
  `process_view` — supported but undocumented-as-API.
- **Async posture.** The stock toolbar middleware is async-capable
  (`async_capable = True` in its recent releases) and the subclass inherits
  that capability flag; but this card's test vehicle is sync WSGI, so the
  async path ships **unverified** and unclaimed
  ([Risks](#risks-and-open-questions)). Nothing in the two overrides is
  coroutine-hostile (they run in the sync `_postprocess` hook the stock
  middleware calls from either mode), which is exactly as far as this card's
  claim goes.
- **`override_settings(INSTALLED_APPS=...)` in a `loadscope` suite.** Django's
  test utilities re-populate the app registry on `INSTALLED_APPS` change and
  restore it on exit; the fixture scopes the override to each test (or the
  module's fixture) so no toolbar state leaks into neighboring files — and
  `pytest.ini`'s `--dist loadscope` keeps the whole module on one worker, the
  same isolation story every registry-touching test file in the suite already
  relies on. **The toolbar's own module- and class-level caches do NOT reset
  with the settings override**, though — `show_toolbar_func_or_path` is
  `@cache`-memoized and `DebugToolbar._panel_classes` / `_urlpatterns` are
  class attributes — so the fixture clears the callback cache and
  saves / clears / restores the class caches on setup and teardown
  (Decision 9's cache-hygiene contract). Under `--dist loadscope` a
  leaked always-true callback would otherwise let this module pass while a
  later same-worker test inherits it; the cache clears close that hole.
- **Template `Content-Length` refresh.** Both mutation paths (`response.write`
  on HTML, `response.content = ...` on JSON) refresh `Content-Length` only
  when the header is already present — Django's `HttpResponse` normally
  computes it at serialization time, but a middleware or server layer that
  pre-set it would otherwise serve a truncated body. Upstream's guard, kept.

## Test plan

All in `tests/middleware/test_debug_toolbar.py` (placement per
[Decision 9](#decision-9--test-strategy-package-tests-driving-real-in-process-fakeshop-requests-under-settings-overrides-eviction-simulated-absence)).
The toolbar-present tests share the one fixture specified in Decision 9's
fixture contract — a setup-time `schema_reload.reload_all_project_schemas()`
call first (the acceptance suites' order-independence-by-reconstruction
discipline, Decision 9), then `DEBUG=True`, `INSTALLED_APPS + "debug_toolbar"`,
`MIDDLEWARE` built from the real `settings.MIDDLEWARE` with the package dotted
path inserted near the front, `ROOT_URLCONF =
"tests.middleware.debug_toolbar_urls"` (referenced by dotted path only — never
imported at test-module import time — and evicted from `sys.modules` on both
setup and teardown so its `urlpatterns` are always computed under `DEBUG=True`),
and `DEBUG_TOOLBAR_CONFIG = {"SHOW_TOOLBAR_CALLBACK": <always-true>}`, plus the
mandatory `show_toolbar_func_or_path.cache_clear()` and the save / clear /
restore of `DebugToolbar._panel_classes`/`_urlpatterns` on setup and teardown —
driving fakeshop's real `/graphql/` URL through `django.test.Client`. The
toolbar-present group carries a module- or class-level `pytest.mark.django_db`
(Decision 9); the absence / guard tests (9–12), the targeted coverage units
(13–15), and the template-port guard (16) stay unmarked. **Every
product-query test's first executable line is `seed_data(1)`** (or an explicit
`seed_data(N)`) from `apps.products.services` — the repo's seed-helper rule; the
panel payload does not depend on row counts, but the query must hit real rows to
emit SQL. The absence / guard tests (9–12) deliberately import **no** fakeshop
catalog helper.

**Toolbar-present — the GraphiQL HTML path:**

1. GET `/graphql/` (the GraphiQL IDE page) returns 200 HTML carrying **both**
   injections: the stock toolbar handle (`id="djDebug"` — proving
   `super()._postprocess` ran and the stock pipeline is intact) and the
   package's appended template script (a distinctive substring of the asset —
   proving the HTML branch fired). `Content-Length`, when present, matches
   `len(response.content)` after the append.
2. The same GET **without** the settings fixture (stock fakeshop settings, no
   toolbar) asserts **stable behavior, not byte-equality** (a Strawberry-rendered,
   `ensure_csrf_cookie`-wrapped page has no checked-in golden file): status 200,
   an HTML `Content-Type`, the GraphiQL marker present, the package
   debug-toolbar script **absent**, and the stock toolbar handle **absent**.
   This is the no-toolbar baseline proving the card changes nothing for
   consumers who don't opt in; pinning it here makes a future settings-bleed
   regression fail in this file, not an unrelated one. Deliberately **no**
   "package middleware module not imported" assertion: under `--dist loadscope`
   any toolbar-present test that ran earlier on the same worker leaves
   `django_strawberry_framework.middleware.debug_toolbar` in `sys.modules`, so
   that assertion would pass or fail on local test order alone while the
   response is perfectly clean. Import-surface guarantees belong to the absence
   tests (9–12), which evict and restore modules deliberately.

**Toolbar-present — the JSON operation path:**

3. `seed_data(1)`, then POST a **named** products operation — a non-null
   `operationName` in the JSON envelope requires a named operation document, so
   the query is e.g. `query ToolbarItems { allItems(first: 1) { edges { node {
   name category { name } } } } }` with `"operationName": "ToolbarItems"` (an
   anonymous `{ ... }` document plus a non-null `operationName` fails GraphQL
   validation before proving anything; a test that wants an anonymous operation
   must send `"operationName": null` or omit the key): the
   200 JSON response body carries `debugToolbar` with a non-empty `panels`
   mapping and a `requestId`; the `SQLPanel` entry is present with a non-null
   `subtitle` (the query count — the SQL the operation actually emitted);
   `TemplatesPanel` is absent from the mapping (the skip); the response's
   own `data` key is intact beside the injected one; and `Content-Length`, if
   present on the response after injection, equals `len(response.content)` (a
   behavior check only — the header-present refresh **branches** are owned by
   the targeted unit Test 15 below, since a real Strawberry `HttpResponse` may
   reach the middleware without the header set, Django normally computing it at
   serialization time).
4. POST with `operationName: "IntrospectionQuery"` (a real introspection
   document): the response body carries **no** `debugToolbar` key and is
   otherwise a normal introspection result
   ([Decision 8](#decision-8--the-introspection-query-skip-is-preserved-verbatim)).
5. **GET `/graphql/?query=...` requesting JSON deterministically** — send
   `HTTP_ACCEPT="application/json"` so Strawberry's Django view returns the JSON
   result, not the GraphiQL HTML page. **Assert `Content-Type` is
   `application/json` before** inspecting the body, then assert the payload is
   injected: this exercises the broad-except `operationName` sniff branch (the
   GET body is empty, `json.loads` raises → `operationName` is `None` → inject).
   The explicit `Accept` header is what keeps this test on the JSON branch
   instead of accidentally re-covering the HTML path of Test 1.

**Toolbar-present — the panel-content route (the actual user story):**

6. `seed_data(1)`, POST the named products operation of Test 3, and capture
   `debugToolbar.requestId` from the JSON body. Then GET the toolbar's
   `render_panel` view through the fixture's `debug_toolbar_urls()` routes —
   `GET /__debug__/render_panel/?request_id=<id>&panel_id=SQLPanel` under the
   default prefix (the test resolves the path via the route, staying correct if
   the fixture ever passes a custom `debug_toolbar_urls(prefix=...)`) — and
   assert what debug-toolbar 7.0.0 actually returns: a **JSON** response
   ([`render_panel`][debug-toolbar-views-source] responds with a JSON body
   carrying `content` and `scripts` keys, keyed off `request_id` / `panel_id`
   query parameters) whose `content` is the **stored SQL-panel content for
   this id**. "Non-empty" is not enough to prove that: when
   `DebugToolbar.fetch()` finds nothing for the `request_id`, `render_panel`
   returns 200 JSON with a *non-empty* `content` too — the fallback "Data for
   this panel isn't available anymore. Please reload the page and retry."
   So the test pins the success direction on both sides: the fallback message
   is **absent**, and at least one SQL-panel-specific marker from the seeded
   operation is **present** (the rendered panel content contains the
   operation's SELECT — e.g. the products table name). A broken store
   round-trip (wrong id captured, per-test isolation eating the record, an id
   from a different toolbar instance) then fails instead of passing on shape.
   Inspecting the `requestId` in the JSON (Test 3) proves the id exists;
   **this** test proves the id is *usable* — the id round-trips to the stored
   panel content through the real route, which Tests 3/5 alone do not prove.
   (It does not guard against a *missing* URLconf — omitting
   `debug_toolbar_urls()` crashes every toolbar-processed request with
   `NoReverseMatch` long before any panel fetch, per the
   [User-facing API](#user-facing-api).)

**Toolbar-present — detection mechanics:**

7. Detection's negative direction for HTML, parametrized over both Django
   dispatch shapes: a non-Strawberry **function-based** view (fakeshop's `/`
   index) and a non-Strawberry **class-based** view (Django's own `LoginView`
   at fakeshop's `/login/`) each return their normal HTML with **no
   package-appended template script** and **no** `debugToolbar` anywhere in the
   body — the `_is_graphiql=False` passthrough for both `view_func` and
   `view_class` dispatch. The negative assertion is deliberately
   **package-scoped, not toolbar-scoped**: the fixture's always-true show
   callback means the **stock** toolbar handle (`id="djDebug"`) may legitimately
   appear in this ordinary HTML, because the package middleware subclasses and
   preserves stock behavior — asserting "no stock toolbar" here would fail for
   the wrong reason. The positive direction needs no separate test: the
   GraphiQL/JSON requests in Tests 1/3/5/6 already run through the real
   `ensure_csrf_cookie(GraphQLView.as_view(...))` URLconf, so a passing Test 3
   IS the proof that `view_class` + `issubclass(..., BaseView)` resolves
   through `functools.wraps`-copied attributes.
8. Detection's negative direction for **JSON** — the payload leak guard. The
   HTML negatives above cannot prove it: an implementation that injected
   `debugToolbar` into *every* JSON response would still pass Tests 1–7. The
   test URLconf module gains a tiny test-only **JSON probe view** (a plain
   Django function view returning `JsonResponse({"probe": "ok"})`, defined in
   `tests/middleware/debug_toolbar_urls.py` beside the composed fakeshop
   `urlpatterns` + `debug_toolbar_urls()`); with the toolbar fixture active,
   GET it through `django.test.Client` and assert the response is JSON, the
   probe body round-trips unmodified, and there is **no** top-level
   `debugToolbar` key. Stock debug-toolbar *headers* on the response are
   acceptable — the contract under test is "unrelated JSON bodies are never
   mutated", not "the stock toolbar ignores the request".

**Toolbar-absent (simulated via eviction + a `sys.modules["debug_toolbar"] =
None` importlib sentinel — Revision 5; the `builtins.__import__` block the
router/DRF fixtures use is a no-op for this `importlib`-based guard):**

9. `import django_strawberry_framework` and
   `import django_strawberry_framework.middleware` both succeed;
   `from django_strawberry_framework import *` binds no toolbar name.
10. `import django_strawberry_framework.middleware.debug_toolbar` raises
    `ImportError` whose message contains `django-debug-toolbar>=7.0.0` — the
    **hint**, not the bare `ModuleNotFoundError` (proving `require_debug_toolbar()`
    wrapped it, which the sentinel makes possible and the block would not) —
    matched against the **re-typed literal** in the test file (the
    `_HINT_SUBSTRING` discipline), with the original `ImportError` chained
    (`__cause__`).
11. After restore, the module imports again in the same process and
    `django_strawberry_framework.middleware.debug_toolbar is
    sys.modules["django_strawberry_framework.middleware.debug_toolbar"]` —
    the two-sided-restore invariant (D3), making the present-path tests
    order-independent under `pytest-xdist`.

**Test 11a — present-but-broken install (degraded path).** Leave a
real/importable top-level `debug_toolbar` but make its `middleware` submodule
unimportable (`sys.modules["debug_toolbar.middleware"] = None`, or a narrow
`importlib.import_module` monkeypatch for that exact submodule).
`require_debug_toolbar()` **passes** (it imports only the top-level package),
then the leaf's own `import debug_toolbar.middleware` statement fails: assert
`import django_strawberry_framework.middleware.debug_toolbar` raises the **raw**
`ImportError` naming `debug_toolbar.middleware` — **without**
`_DEBUG_TOOLBAR_INSTALL_HINT` — and that `__cause__` is the original failing
import. This pins the [Error shapes](#error-shapes) contract that the guard
wraps only the top-level package and never misreports a broken install as "not
installed" (the numbered plan previously claimed to pin this but did not —
Revision 5).

**Test 11b — installed but absent from `INSTALLED_APPS` (the wiring gate).**
Leave `debug_toolbar` importable but with `"debug_toolbar"` **omitted** from
`INSTALLED_APPS` (fakeshop's shipped default), and evict only the framework leaf
so its body re-runs. `require_debug_toolbar()` **passes**, and — before the
`debug_toolbar.middleware` import that would otherwise surface Django's cryptic
`HistoryEntry` app-label `RuntimeError` — the `apps.is_installed("debug_toolbar")`
gate raises `ImproperlyConfigured` naming the fix (asserted against the
`INSTALLED_APPS` substring). This pins the second [Error shapes](#error-shapes)
contract: a missing app is reported as a settings error, neither misfiled as
"not installed" nor leaked as the raw model-registration `RuntimeError`.

**Guard unit shape:**

12. `require_debug_toolbar()` returns the imported `debug_toolbar` module when
    present (identity with `sys.modules["debug_toolbar"]`), and under the
    `None` sentinel raises the hint-carrying `ImportError` — the thin-wrapper
    contract over
    [`require_optional_module`][glossary-require-optional-module] (whose own
    unit tests, landed with [`spec-041`][spec-041], are not duplicated here).
    (Under a `builtins.__import__` block this assertion would fail: the guard's
    `importlib.import_module` call bypasses the block and returns the still
    installed toolbar — Revision 5.)

**Coverage-only targeted units** (branches the real toolbar lifecycle does not
naturally expose through Tests 1–8; unmarked, no database, direct calls with
stub objects — mock only where the real path is impossible, per the
[coverage-priority rule][glossary-live-first-coverage-mandate]). One shared
constraint shapes all three: the package override calls
`super()._postprocess(...)` **before** its own branches, so any unit that
enters `_postprocess` runs the stock toolbar postprocess first — the fake
toolbar must therefore implement the small stock-toolbar protocol
`debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware._postprocess` consumes
(`enabled_panels`, `render_toolbar()`, and no-op panel record/generate hooks),
or use a real toolbar instance where that is simpler:

13. **Streaming early-out** — call `_postprocess` with a
    `StreamingHttpResponse` and a protocol-complete fake toolbar, and assert
    **no package-specific mutation after the stock postprocess returns**: no
    appended template script, no `debugToolbar` payload, unchanged streaming
    content. Not "returns without touching the response" in the absolute
    sense — the stock postprocess runs first and may legitimately generate
    stats and headers before `if response.streaming` sends the package branch
    home. No listed real-request test returns a streaming response, so the
    branch is unreachable through Tests 1–8.
14. **`_get_payload` no-`request_id` bail** — call `_get_payload` with a stub
    toolbar whose `request_id` is `None` and assert `None`: under the fixture's
    always-true show callback the real toolbar always assigns a `request_id`,
    so the bail never fires in the real-request tests. The same test (or a
    sibling case) drives a stub panel with `has_content` false, since real
    default panels do not reliably produce both `has_content` outcomes across
    toolbar versions. A further sibling case drives the **non-object-body bail**
    (the P2.3 guard): a response whose decoded JSON is a list (not a mapping)
    makes `_get_payload` return `None`, so the JSON path leaves the body
    unmodified. A valid single GraphQL response is always an object, so this
    branch is unreachable through the real-request tests.

**Test 14a — `process_view` non-class `view_class` guard.** Call `process_view`
with a `view_func` whose `view_class` attribute is a non-class value (e.g. the
string `"not-a-class"`) and assert `request._is_graphiql` is `False` with **no
exception**. The `isinstance(view, type)` guard (P2.1) short-circuits before
`issubclass`, which would otherwise raise `TypeError` and 500 the request.
Tests 7–8 only drive real class/function views, so this guard — which matters
precisely because the middleware runs for **all** global traffic, not just
GraphQL — is unreachable through them.

15. **`Content-Length` refresh branches, HTML and JSON** — build responses
    with `Content-Length` explicitly pre-set, run the mutation paths, and
    assert the header equals `len(response.content)` after. These units cover
    the package's refresh branches **after stock postprocessing has already
    run** (the pre-set header is the point: a real Strawberry `HttpResponse`
    may reach the middleware without the header, so the header-present
    branches need it planted).

**Template-port guard** (mechanical, no JS runtime — reads the asset, executes
nothing):

16. Render (or read) `templates/django_strawberry_framework/debug_toolbar.html`
    and assert the five [template-port checklist](#from-strawberry-graphql-django--borrow-the-mechanism-verbatim)
    invariants as substring/pattern checks: the `JSON.parse` wrapper, the
    `Response.prototype.json` wrapper, `delete data.debugToolbar`, the
    `data-request-id` update on `#djDebug`, and the per-panel title / subtitle
    DOM updates. The suite has no JS runtime, so this does not prove the script
    *works* — it turns the checklist's by-eye diff into a mechanical guard that
    fails if a future edit drops one of the load-bearing behaviors.

Coverage: the package gate is `fail_under = 100`, and each branch has a named
owner rather than an implicit hope. Reached by the **real-request tests
(1–8)**: the guard's success path, both `_postprocess` main branches (HTML —
Test 1; JSON — Tests 3/5), the non-GraphiQL early-out (HTML — Test 7; JSON —
Test 8), the introspection skip (Test 4), the `operationName` except-branch
(Test 5), the `TemplatesPanel` skip and the `has_content`-true panel path
(Test 3), and the panel-route round trip (Test 6). Reached by the
**absence / guard tests (9–12, incl. the degraded-install Test 11a and the
missing-app wiring-gate Test 11b)**: the guard's raise path, the import-surface
matrix, the raw-`ImportError` propagation for a present-but-broken install, and
the `apps.is_installed` wiring gate's `ImproperlyConfigured` raise. Reached **only by the targeted
units (13–15, incl. 14a)**: the streaming early-out, the no-`request_id` bail /
`has_content`-false / non-object-body branches of `_get_payload`, the
`isinstance(view, type)` detection guard, and both header-present
`Content-Length` refreshes. The template-port guard (16) earns no Python
coverage — the asset is markup and JavaScript, not
counted lines; it exists to pin the port's five invariants mechanically. If
implementation finds another
branch unreachable through real requests, it gets its own targeted unit the
same way — the fallback is named per branch, never a blanket claim that the
numbered real-request tests reach everything.

## Doc updates

Slice 2, per the F8 split in
[Decision 10](#decision-10--version-bumps-are-owned-by-the-joint-0014-cut) —
implemented-on-main docs update here; release-status wording defers to the
joint `0.0.14` cut:

- [`docs/GLOSSARY.md`][glossary] — the
  [Debug-toolbar middleware][glossary-debug-toolbar-middleware] entry body
  grows the implemented contract: the dotted settings path and the
  replace-the-stock-entry rule, the required `debug_toolbar_urls()` URLconf
  step **with its true failure mode** (omitting it fails every
  toolbar-processed request with `NoReverseMatch` — the stock postprocess
  renders the toolbar, which reverses `djdt:` routes, for every processed
  response — not "panel clicks 404"), the `BaseView` detection contract (and
  the non-Strawberry-view passthrough), the view-scoped (not IDE-scoped)
  injection contract, the introspection skip, the soft-dependency behavior
  matrix (package import clean / leaf import raises / hint text with the
  `7.0.0` floor), the `INSTALLED_APPS` template-resolution requirement and the
  toolbar's own `django.contrib.staticfiles` + `STATIC_URL` prerequisite
  (whose failure surfaces on `/graphql/` traffic under this middleware), the
  not-a-Channels-integration boundary, and the inherited show-toolbar
  gating. The "distinct from" edge
  to [Response-extensions debug middleware][glossary-response-extensions-debug-middleware]
  stays accurate in both entry bodies. Status **stays `planned for 0.0.14`**
  until the joint cut.
- [`docs/TREE.md`][tree] — regenerated via
  [`scripts/build_tree_md.py`][build-tree-md] after the card flips Done (the
  file is script-rendered; missing module docstrings fail the render, so the
  `middleware/__init__.py` and `middleware/debug_toolbar.py` docstrings are
  written for their rows): the package tree's planned `middleware/` annotations
  resolve to real rows; the test tree gains `tests/middleware/`.
- [`KANBAN.md`][kanban] / `KANBAN.html` — card wrap via the DB + re-render
  (Slice 2 checklist).
- **Deferred to the joint cut:** [`README.md`][readme] /
  [`docs/README.md`][docs-readme] "Coming next — remaining alpha (`0.0.14`)" →
  "Shipped today" moves, the GLOSSARY status flip + package-version line,
  [`TODAY.md`][today]'s coming-next wording, and `CHANGELOG.md` (which
  additionally requires the explicit maintainer grant per [`AGENTS.md`][agents]).

## Risks and open questions

- **`_postprocess` is a private-underscore method of `django-debug-toolbar`.**
  The subclass overrides (and chains to) a method the toolbar does not
  advertise as API; a toolbar major release could rename or reshape it, and
  the `>=7.0.0` floor is deliberately unbounded above (the package pins
  floors, not ceilings). This is a knowingly borrowed coupling — upstream
  carries the identical override (decorated `@override`, so upstream CI
  notices a rename) and the archived `django-graphiql-debug-toolbar` before it
  did too; the mechanism has been stable across the toolbar's 4.x → 7.x line.
  **Preferred posture:** accept the coupling; the behavior-level tests
  (Tests 1, 3) fail loudly on any reshape, and the fix tracks upstream's fix.
  **Fallback:** if a toolbar release breaks the hook, the gate that catches it
  (the suite under a refreshed lockfile) also scopes the repair — worst case
  the floor gains a temporary ceiling with a follow-on card, the same
  containment any soft dependency carries.
- **The `7.0.0` floor is metadata-grounded, not yet suite-verified.** Per PyPI
  metadata, `7.0.0` is the first release with the Django 6.0 classifier
  (`6.0.0` stops at 5.2), and its `django>=5.2` / `python>=3.10` floors match
  the package's own. The Slice-1 dependency gate installs it and the worker
  records the pytest command for the maintainer to run (not run by the worker
  itself, per [`AGENTS.md`][agents]) before the hint string freezes.
  **Preferred answer:** `7.0.0` holds and all naming sites ship with it. **Fallback:** the gate moves all sites
  together — the dev-group specifier, the `_DEBUG_TOOLBAR_INSTALL_HINT`
  string, and the re-typed test literal — the three-places-that-must-agree
  rule, verbatim from [`spec-041`][spec-041].
- **The card's view-detection hedge, resolved against a package fact.** The
  card's architectural posture names a "working name `DjangoGraphQLView`...
  pinned during implementation"; this spec pins the target as engine-owned
  `strawberry.django.views.BaseView` instead, because the package ships no
  view class and fakeshop wires Strawberry's views directly
  ([Decision 7](#decision-7--strawberry-view-detection-issubclass-against-strawberrydjangoviewsbaseview-engine-owned--resolving-the-cards-djangographqlview-hedge)).
  This is the card's own hedge resolving in the direction its "same
  `issubclass` check" sentence already pointed (upstream's check targets
  `BaseView` too), not a card conflict — recorded per the
  [`docs/SPECS/NEXT.md`][next] prefer-the-card rule: if a future card ships a
  package view class, the one `issubclass` line is that card's to update.
- **`BaseView` presence at the Strawberry floor is upstream history.** Verified
  at the installed strawberry 0.316.0; the Slice-1 gate re-confirms
  importability at the pinned `strawberry-graphql==0.262.0` floor in a
  throwaway venv. **Preferred answer:** present (the class predates the
  package's floor by a wide margin). **Fallback:** bump the project's
  Strawberry floor — the same recourse the [`spec-041`][spec-041] consumer
  gate named.
- **App-registry churn from per-test `INSTALLED_APPS` overrides.** Django's
  test utilities support it and the suite's `--dist loadscope` keeps the
  module on one worker, but registry re-population interacts with anything
  else module-scoped that caches app state. **Preferred answer:** the fixture
  is test-scoped, the suite's existing registry-sensitive files prove the
  pattern, and any surfaced flake is fixed at source (the
  [`tests/conftest.py`][tests-conftest] precedent — never by weakening the
  suite's `-W error` posture). **Fallback:** promote the overrides to a
  module-scoped fixture with an explicit teardown ordering, still inside
  `tests/middleware/`.
- **Schema-registry order-dependence on a shared worker.** Package tests
  `registry.clear()` for isolation; these tests execute real GraphQL from the
  same tree, the documented `LazyType` `KeyError` class
  ([`test_query/README.md`][test-query-readme]). **Preferred answer:** the
  fixture's setup-time `schema_reload.reload_all_project_schemas()` call
  (Decision 9) reconstructs the whole project schema per test — the same
  order-independence-by-reconstruction every live acceptance suite's autouse
  fixture already relies on, via the same single-sited helper (never a
  narrower private reload). **Fallback:** none anticipated; a surfaced flake
  in this class is fixed in the shared helper, at source.
- **The async path ships unverified.** The stock middleware is async-capable
  and the overrides run in hooks it calls from either mode, but no test
  drives `AsyncGraphQLView` or an ASGI stack. **Preferred answer for
  `0.0.14`:** ship sync-verified with the GLOSSARY body claiming exactly that;
  async verification rides whichever card first gives the suite an async
  request vehicle (the [`TestClient`][glossary-testclient] card's
  `AsyncTestClient` is the natural owner). **Fallback:** if the joint cut
  wants the claim earlier, a dedicated async smoke test is a small follow-on,
  not a redesign.

## Out of scope (explicitly tracked elsewhere)

- **Response-extensions debug middleware** (`extensions["debug"]`, graphene
  parity) — [`TODO-ALPHA-044-0.0.14`][kanban]
  ([Response-extensions debug middleware][glossary-response-extensions-debug-middleware]);
  the two entries' "distinct from" cross-links are kept accurate by Slice 2.
- **`TestClient` / `GraphQLTestCase` helpers** — [`TODO-ALPHA-043-0.0.14`][kanban]
  ([`TestClient`][glossary-testclient] / [`GraphQLTestCase`][glossary-graphqltestcase]);
  this card's tests use `django.test.Client` directly. The async verification
  handoff ([Risks](#risks-and-open-questions)) lands there if anywhere.
- **Fakeshop toolbar dogfooding** (a `DEBUG`-gated settings opt-in in the
  example) — the fakeshop-activation card [`TODO-BETA-053-0.1.5`][kanban] if
  the maintainer wants it; when it lands, the covering tests move live and the
  package stand-ins are deleted per the
  [live-first promotion rule][glossary-live-first-coverage-mandate].
- **The migration guide itself** — [`TODO-BETA-056-0.1.6`][kanban]; this card
  hands it the one-row settings-string mapping
  (`strawberry_django.middlewares.debug_toolbar.DebugToolbarMiddleware` →
  `django_strawberry_framework.middleware.debug_toolbar.DebugToolbarMiddleware`,
  behavior unchanged) ([Goal 3](#goals)).
- **The `0.0.14` version bump and release-status flips** — the joint `0.0.14`
  cut ([Decision 10](#decision-10--version-bumps-are-owned-by-the-joint-0014-cut)).

## Definition of done

- [ ] `django_strawberry_framework/middleware/debug_toolbar.py` exists, with
      module + symbol docstrings, exposing `DebugToolbarMiddleware`
      (subclassing `debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware`,
      overriding `process_view` + `_postprocess` per
      [Decision 6](#decision-6--subclass-and-override-borrowed-as-is-process_view--_postprocess-_get_payload-_html_types))
      behind the import-time `require_debug_toolbar()` guard (a thin wrapper
      over `utils/imports.py::require_optional_module` — Helper-reuse D1).
- [ ] The template asset ships at
      `django_strawberry_framework/templates/django_strawberry_framework/debug_toolbar.html`
      and the middleware renders it via `render_to_string(...)` into GraphiQL
      HTML responses; the port preserves upstream's five invariants
      ([template-port checklist](#borrowing-posture))
      ([Decision 4](#decision-4--module-template-and-test-locations-a-middleware-subpackage-an-in-package-template-asset-testsmiddleware)).
- [ ] The public wiring documents **all three** toolbar pieces — app,
      middleware (near the front of `MIDDLEWARE`, replacing the stock entry,
      after any response-encoding middleware), **and** `debug_toolbar_urls()`
      in the URLconf — and the toolbar-present tests wire `ROOT_URLCONF =
      "tests.middleware.debug_toolbar_urls"` (composing fakeshop's
      `urlpatterns` + `debug_toolbar_urls()`) **by dotted path only**, the
      module never imported at test-module import time and evicted from
      `sys.modules` on fixture setup and teardown so its `urlpatterns` are
      always computed under `DEBUG=True`
      ([User-facing API](#user-facing-api) / [Decision 9](#decision-9--test-strategy-package-tests-driving-real-in-process-fakeshop-requests-under-settings-overrides-eviction-simulated-absence)).
- [ ] The injection contract is stated honestly: injection is view-scoped
      (every JSON response from a Strawberry Django view while the toolbar is
      enabled, minus `IntrospectionQuery`), **not** IDE-scoped — no wording
      promises "only the IDE's own fetches"
      ([Decision 6](#decision-6--subclass-and-override-borrowed-as-is-process_view--_postprocess-_get_payload-_html_types) / [User-facing API](#user-facing-api)).
- [ ] The spec states plainly this is a Django HTTP-middleware integration
      around Strawberry's Django views, **not** a Channels/ASGI toolbar for the
      [`DjangoGraphQLProtocolRouter`][glossary-djangographqlprotocolrouter];
      ASGI/Channels behavior is neither claimed nor tested ([Non-goals](#non-goals)).
- [ ] `django-debug-toolbar` is a soft dependency: `import
      django_strawberry_framework` and `import
      django_strawberry_framework.middleware` succeed without it; importing the
      leaf module raises `ImportError` carrying the single install hint naming
      the verified floor (the card's DoD, sharpened by
      [Decision 5](#decision-5--soft-django-debug-toolbar-dependency-an-import-time-require_debug_toolbar-guard-the-rest_framework-shape)).
- [ ] Strawberry-view detection targets `strawberry.django.views.BaseView`
      and is proven through fakeshop's real decorated URLconf
      ([Decision 7](#decision-7--strawberry-view-detection-issubclass-against-strawberrydjangoviewsbaseview-engine-owned--resolving-the-cards-djangographqlview-hedge)).
- [ ] The introspection-query skip is preserved: no payload injection when
      `operationName == "IntrospectionQuery"`
      ([Decision 8](#decision-8--the-introspection-query-skip-is-preserved-verbatim)).
- [ ] **`django-debug-toolbar>=7.0.0`** (or the floor the Slice-1 gate proves,
      moving all naming sites together) is in `[dependency-groups].dev` with
      `uv.lock` regenerated in the same commit; the dev-group specifier, the
      hint string, and the re-typed test literal agree on the **single** floor
      covering the advertised Django range through 6.0.
- [ ] The Strawberry view-class gate ran: `strawberry.django.views.BaseView`
      confirmed importable at `strawberry-graphql==0.262.0` in an isolated
      throwaway venv (never the shared `.venv`), or the project's Strawberry
      floor was bumped instead; the command and outcome are recorded in the
      build artifact.
- [ ] `tests/middleware/test_debug_toolbar.py` covers both dependency states
      per the [Test plan](#test-plan) — including the real GraphiQL HTML
      injection, the real SQL-emitting **named** JSON operation (each
      product-query test starting with `seed_data(1)`) with the `SQLPanel`
      entry present and
      `TemplatesPanel` absent, the introspection skip, the deterministic
      JSON-`Accept` GET branch, the **panel-content fetch through
      `debug_toolbar_urls()` using the injected `requestId`** (asserting
      `render_panel`'s JSON `content`/`scripts` shape with the fallback
      "isn't available anymore" message **absent** and a SQL-panel marker from
      the seeded operation **present**), the non-GraphiQL passthroughs (HTML **and** the JSON-probe
      leak guard), the two-sided-restore absence
      matrix, the coverage-only targeted units (streaming early-out,
      no-`request_id` bail / `has_content`-false, header-present
      `Content-Length` refreshes), and the template-port guard over the five
      copied-asset invariants — the toolbar-present group marked
      `pytest.mark.django_db`, with the fixture's mandatory
      `show_toolbar_func_or_path.cache_clear()` + `DebugToolbar` cache
      save/clear/restore on setup/teardown — and the package coverage gate
      (`fail_under = 100`) holds with `middleware/debug_toolbar.py` included,
      each branch mapped to a named test owner.
- [ ] The migration-guide handoff row content is recorded for
      [`TODO-BETA-056-0.1.6`][kanban] (the one settings-string swap, behavior
      unchanged) ([Goal 3](#goals)).
- [ ] Slice 2 doc updates land per [Doc updates](#doc-updates): the GLOSSARY
      entry body (status flip deferred), the regenerated
      [`docs/TREE.md`][tree], and the kanban card wrap (DB edit + re-render).
- [ ] **No slice bumps the version** — `pyproject.toml` / `__version__` /
      [`tests/base/test_init.py`][test-base-init] still read `0.0.13` when this
      card flips Done; the joint `0.0.14` cut owns the bump
      ([Decision 10](#decision-10--version-bumps-are-owned-by-the-joint-0014-cut)).
- [ ] `uv run ruff format .` / `ruff check --fix .` clean; no `pytest` beyond
      the slices' own test additions unless the maintainer asks (the
      [`START.md`][start] workflow rule).
